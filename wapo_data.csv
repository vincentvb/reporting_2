0,"September 1, 2019","On this Labor Day weekend, we check in with readers who wrote in earlier for advice.From the female manager struggling to shed the “girl” label at work: WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThank you for your advice on being the “girl at work.” I don’t think I’ve made any real progress in changing the culture, but at least speaking up now feels more routine and less earth-shattering/job-compromising/aggressive, just like correcting a poor pronunciation of my name. And, although top-down change seems unlikely, I now have a plan on how to bring this up with other senior managers, in a way that hopefully nudges a bottom-up change.Also, I was amused by readers’ assumptions about where I was writing from. I’m actually working in a supposedly progressive city.Story continues below  From the reader with an overly huggy co-worker:We had a serious conversation, and she received that quite well. Everything has been fine since. She seems able to contain the spontaneous hugging, and she’s a wonderful addition to the team. While it wasn’t really bothersome to any of us, my concern was that we weren’t serving her well if we didn’t say that in the professional world it’s not okay and could damage her reputation as a highly competent professional.AdvertisementReaders of this column from the Sunday Magazine days may remember the 14-year-old seeking advice on how to get a job to help support the family, including two unemployed adult siblings and divorced parents living under the same roof. Here’s an update, two years later:Story continues below  I’m now a rising junior in high school. My siblings still haven’t gotten jobs, but they have gotten pretty close. We’re still struggling financially, but we’re a lot more stable now ever since my siblings and I moved with my mother out of my father’s house. I would apply for jobs as a 16-year-old, but my mom suggests that I enjoy my childhood while I can.I have a bit of great news. For over a year I’ve been part of a team developing a modification in a video game. I’m the texture artist. Although I don’t get paid, it’s certainly a great learning experience. Writing and drawing are really fun for me, and I want my future to be about them.AdvertisementI got into this when I was browsing the online community forums of one of my favorite games and volunteered to help a developer who needed design help for a game modification. I met other community members and became friends with other artists on the project.Story continues below  Eventually we left because the developer was making sexist and racist jokes and treating the female artists worse than the males. Now I am working with other community members on our own game modification, and we hope to earn royalties for it.When someone you’re working for disrespects you, then they’re not worth it. Start your own project or look for someone who will show you the respect you need.Karla: So you have a side gig doing what you love, and you already have a good sense of what you will and won’t accept from an employer. All I can add is, don’t be shy about asking to be paid for your next gig — your time and skills are valuable. But you seem to have things well in hand. Keep us posted!"
1,"September 6, 2019","Reader: There is a VP at my company who is two reporting levels above me. We attend some meetings together. Often she will start talking at length about one of her stepdaughters, who has special needs. She will disparage the child and the child's mother and go on about how crazy this child drives her. It makes everyone uncomfortable, but since she's the highest-ranked person in the room, most of us nod and try to empathize.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI have a child with special needs who seems to have some traits in common with the VP's stepdaughter.Whenever the VP starts talking about her stepdaughter, I feel as if she is diminishing my child as well. I've tried to change the topic or, in a more private setting, speak up for the challenges that the stepdaughter may be facing. But it is as if she does not hear or care.   I cannot keep hearing her talk about a child with special needs in this way. And yet the power dynamic is obviously on her side, and she has pushed out several people she does not like. Please advise. Also, in case you'd tell me to go to HR, she is the VP of HR.Karla: To recap, this powerful individual dominates meetings with complaints about her personal life, expresses zero compassion for her stepchild, and basically sounds like she’s one poisoned apple away from being a villain right out of fairy tale central casting. I somehow doubt she has the professionalism, empathy or self-awareness to change her behavior in response to subtle feedback from underlings.Since making a direct appeal to her seems pointless and potentially career-harming, and my next recommendation of conferring with HR is out — nice kicker, there — your other option for confronting this problem would be to go over her head, perhaps with your direct supervisor’s support.   If you want to try that route, employment law partner Amy Epstein Gluck, of FisherBroyles, recommends an in-person meeting with the VP’s direct superior, where you state that as a parent of a child with special needs, you find the statements about her special-needs stepchild insulting and derogatory, but you don’t feel secure confronting her directly. Epstein Gluck advises that you document the conversation with a follow-up email so you have something in writing in case she tries to retaliate against you for reporting her.But there is a middle ground between confrontation and implicit assent: purposeful non-reaction. Next time the VP starts nattering on in a group about the unmanageable stepchild or the incompetent mother, focus silently on something in your lap and stay disengaged until the topic changes. Odds are she won’t notice your withdrawal, but if she does, and comments on it, that gives you an opening: “Oh, you just reminded me of what my own kid is going through with [condition or disability]. It sounds like your poor kid is struggling, too.” All at once and non-combatively, you’ve just drawn your boundaries, identified where your sympathies lie, and invited a roomful of witnesses to choose a side. That’s not to say the VP won’t lash out if she recognizes how bad her reflection looks in your response, but no reasonable witness could argue that she was rightly provoked."
2,"September 13, 2019","Reader: I work in a quasi-governmental organization. My office is a public-access point for journalists, organizations and regular citizens to chime in and share information about issues of public interest. We often get phone calls and letters from people who seem unstable. Some see dark conspiracies, some report suffering fantastical events such as being killed repeatedly and brought back to life. Most of these callers just want to talk, and some of their stories are quite sad.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightInterns handle most of these phone calls, and we train them in how to maintain boundaries. They are not to put up with abuse, and they are to alert us if they are uncomfortable. We try to be helpful and refer callers to other organizations when appropriate. So far, we are not aware of callers escalating their engagement to in-person meetings, but when drop-by visitors want to meet in person, we have staff meet them in the lobby near the guard station.Could we be making things worse by engaging with these callers? Are there best practices we should be following? Recent news reports about violent incidents in public places, and imagining how encounters with callers could go bad, seem to warrant a review of our policies.    Karla: Like government and political offices, law firms, health clinics and media outlets, your organization has to walk a fine line between being responsive to a public clientele and being vulnerable to potential threats from that clientele.Are you making things worse by engaging with unstable callers? “Isolation is one of the key problems” with troubled individuals, says Chuck Tobin, president and CEO of threat assessment firm At-Risk International and former director of security for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.Tobin recommends being “respectful in engagement” and “creating a community of care” — so your policy of helping when possible is not only compassionate but also probably does more good than harm. Still, you are presumably not responsible for managing these people’s well-being, and you don’t want staff burning up time and resources that should be spent fulfilling your primary mission.   Training interns in boundary-setting and escalating concerns to senior employees is also a smart measure. But what do you then do with those escalated concerns? What if the same caller makes multiple contacts to different people or becomes fixated on an issue or a member of your staff? How do you keep track of those repeat contacts?Finally, while your organization has a responsibility to provide a safe workspace for its employees, your preventive measures should be based on a realistic perception of the threats you face — not on preconceived notions about people with mental illness or fear stoked by what seems like a weekly/daily/hourly cycle of national tragedies.For these reasons, you might consider investing in a threat assessment and security consultation to help your organization refine its system for handling public contacts efficiently and safely.   As part of that system, Tobin recommends having a centralized reporting mechanism with a team of people trained in monitoring and assessing potential threats and developing appropriate responses. Everyone in your organization should be made aware of when and how to report concerns to the central team.If you’re too small to afford a consultation, Tobin recommends some resources that may help you develop your own practices and policies with a clear-eyed, reality-based mind-set:The FBI’s Behavioral Threat Assessment Center report, “Making Prevention a Reality: Identifying, Assessing and Managing the Threat of Targeted Attacks” includes practical, concrete strategies and guidelines in assessing and managing threats.Story continues below  The Society for Human Resource Management released a survey on workplace violence in March and offers a tool kit, “Understanding Workplace Violence Prevention and Response.” (It requires a login.)For professionals in law enforcement, security, legal and mental-health-care fields who want practical training in threat assessment, the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals provides education and certification to its members."
3,"September 20, 2019","Reader: I am an older woman working in a field among predominantly younger workers and would love insight on how to deal with frequent references to my age. I love what I do and have much to contribute, but the comments are starting to wear on me.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAs an example, at a recent conference when I was about to make a presentation, a younger colleague twice made reference to the fact that I had my notes on 5 x 7 rather than 3 x 5 note cards, saying, ""Guess that's what you gotta do when you get old.""This individual thought she was being funny and wanted to make sure everyone heard the ""joke."" I said nothing, but it pushed all my self-doubt buttons, and I gave a substandard presentation.Story continues below  I understand I could simply ignore such comments. But what I'd love is a simple, honest, thoughtful response — not snarky or confrontational, because I don't think that would stop future comments, but a way to educate the colleague on how inappropriate and harmful these ""jokes"" are.AdvertisementKarla: It’s always fun to fantasize about breezy comebacks (“Well, kiddo, I’d be happy to hand over my cards and let you present, but my notes are all in cursive”). But if you’re looking to make a point, you have several options of varying sharpness.Benefit of the doubt: “I’m sure you were just trying to make a joke, but that just came off as mean.” With a co-worker, you could add: “It also undermines me and, by extension, the employer we’re representing.”Story continues below  Feigned bafflement: “Why would you say such a thing?”Anyone who is capable of shame and truly means no harm will apologize on the spot. But you’re talking about someone who used her bizarrely specific eye for detail to draw attention to what she saw as a sign of weakness. This is not the behavior of a well-meaning professional secure in her own competence.AdvertisementIn cases like that, go for blunt: “Please stop making those comments. They’re rude, they’re not funny, and they’re ageist.”And assuming you are at least 40, you could add: “And you should know my age is a protected status under federal law.”People who wouldn’t dream of making snide remarks about someone’s race, sex or religion for fear of being sued may not realize that the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) also prohibits discrimination against workers age 40 and older.Story continues below  Laurie McCann, a senior attorney with the AARP Foundation, says general awareness about age discrimination may be lacking because “few employers . . . include age as a component” when providing diversity and anti-discrimination training, focusing instead on more familiar protected classes such as gender, race and religion. Even in litigation, says McCann, “courts tend to treat age comments differently than comments on gender and race.”AdvertisementOf course, you can ignore such comments. But as with racism, sexism and other -isms, it’s harder to ignore the disrespect behind them — or the very real bias older workers face. In a recent AARP national survey of adults older than age 45, 61 percent said they have either seen or experienced age discrimination. Nine in 10 of those said they believe it is somewhat to extremely common.Whether you say anything in the moment, document the incident afterward: what was said, when, by whom, and any witnesses who may have overheard. One stray remark is probably not something you can act on, but a documented pattern might be.Even if you don’t have access to the offenders’ managers, many event organizers have rules of conduct prohibiting attendees from demeaning or harassing others.Pro tip: Learn more about your rights and responses to age discrimination through the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission."
4,"September 28, 2019","Reader: Inspired by your advice, I've made a number of successful changes that involve actively denormalizing the [sexist] microaggressions and empowering others to do the same.First, I have flipped every response to be about the offender or the situation, not me. I realized why my previous responses didn't work: Being humorous (""I'm a grown-up!"") made the situation light enough to dismiss, and being firm (""I'm not a girl"") made people defensive. Also, these ""I"" statements made the issue about my own feelings and preferences — which, again, made it easy to dismiss.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightSecond, I have made every response either (a) dispassionate: ""Huh, I don't think most people really use 'girls' and 'boys' in the workplace anymore,"" or (b) as awkward as possible, with a head cocked in disbelief or an ""okayyyyyy then, moving along,"" as if embarrassed for them. The former pushes them to think about what they said from a nondefensive place, and the second forces them to reflect on what part of what they said was awkward and inappropriate.   Third, I've been consistent in calling it out without exception: women, men, young, old, supervisors and clients. It's become as normal and casual to me as correcting name pronunciation.In my environment, a simple ""Ha! that's an old-fashioned line I don't hear much these days,"" or ""Sounds great, Amy, but let's introduce our team as 'women' when we go in this time,"" has worked really well. By talking with female associates and clients about adjusting our own interactions, I see much better results than if I try to fix everyone's interactions with women. Call-out culture can be perceived as aggressive, and no one likes to be lectured.Fourth, with male managers, I'm slowly bringing up the issue in shoptalk, the way I would share a budget concern or a rushed timeline. For instance, ""Is your team holding up okay after [the supervisor] spent this morning's meeting calling them all 'girls?' ""  or ""My project keeps stalling because of bad morale. Have you had any luck dealing with some of the sexism from [the client]?"" If we're just talking business in a general sense, defenses are down and — as you advised — they have a chance to consider the effect from a bottom-line standpoint.   Finally, I had to file a formal sexual harassment report on a relatively new manager, which gave me an opportunity to discuss not only the specific incident with HR, but also the culture that fosters pervasive harassment and how hard it is to report. Because I presented the Bad Culture as a bottom-line issue and was able to speak to concrete instances, the HR manager was open to the rest of the data and the ""theoreticals.""While I'm not sure what filtered up and out from this discussion with HR — aside from the perpetrator correcting his behavior — I have yet to be called ""girl"" again by anyone with the company!Karla: Much as I’d like to accept the credit, you’re the one who turned suggestions into a customized strategy, diplomatically delivered. And now I have to walk back my earlier position and concede that it may be possible after all to both keep your job and “drag [your] company into 2019.”Pro Tip: As this reader realized, “I” statements, particularly “I feel” statements, are useful in softening personal arguments, but can undermine professional ones.

5,"October 5, 2019","  In this day and age, are we still required to use cover letters when replying to online job postings, especially sites that have one-click ""easy application"" features that let you attach a résumé and apply without going through multiple screens of questions? The basics I would include in a cover letter are already at the top of my résumé.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Imagine you’re a man going to a job interview at a workplace where you’ve been told the dress code is “business casual.” Do you throw a blazer over a button-down shirt and call it a day, or go the extra inch and pop on a necktie? It probably depends on the impression you want to make and how you want to brand yourself. And odds are, in all but the most aggressively casual workplaces, you won’t be penalized for wearing one. So why not?Granted, trying to draft an original cover letter for every application is overkill and a waste of time. Not every interview calls for a necktie of bespoke Italian silk, tastefully patterned and precisely knotted, with a complementary pocket square. Just as you probably have multiple ready-to-share résumés tailored to a variety of jobs, you should also have a selection of prewritten, neutral-tone standard introductory statements to pair with them. It may well be overlooked by most applicant-tracking systems or hiring managers —  but it’s a simple finishing touch, and an opportunity to make a statement about yourself.     I am trying to reenter the workforce after spending some years off with my children, and recently went back to school to earn a master's degree and update my skills. A friend who works in HR tells me that because of my master's degree, I'm overqualified for entry-level positions. But when the gap in my résumé is compared to someone who has been working for the past five years, employers deem the other candidate more reliable. What advice do you have?Karla: Claiming a degree you didn’t earn is a known sin in résumé writing — but when you’re trying to get that first foot in the door, what about not claiming a degree you did earn?“Some people interpret this as ‘dumbing down’ the résumé, but I disagree,” says Lauren Milligan, founder and chief executive of ResuMAYDAY. “A candidate is entitled to leave off information that may dissuade an employer from considering that candidate.”   However, she cautions, you should assume employers will research you online before contacting you for an interview: “If you leave your degree off your résumé, but it’s on your LinkedIn profile, that raises a red flag.”So if you’re sure your advanced degree is a hindrance rather than an asset with the jobs you’re applying to, leave it off your résumé — just make sure you’re consistent about omitting it everywhere.Or, Milligan suggests, “make sure that the rest of the résumé is written so specifically to the position that everything on the résumé [including your degree] becomes an asset.” And, says Milligan, you should be trying to “use any available space to explain the gap” in your work history and how your degree compensates for it. Space such as the summary on your LinkedIn profile, or — ta-da! — a cover letter."
6,"October 12, 2019","Reader: My partner, ""Wanda,"" works for an environmental engineering and construction oversight company. She provides third-party inspection services for general contractors to ensure that work sites are compliant with local and federal regulations.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightWanda has a degree in environmental science and extensive field experience. She is generally confident, well-spoken and professional, and easily establishes friendly relationships with co-workers. She is also young and attractive, and occasionally is harassed by men representing the companies that hire her to be there. What bothers her most are age- and gender-based comments that make her feel small and/or unintelligent.Generally, the culprits are those trying to cut corners, as most of the general contractors understand the value of her input. Her co-workers, mostly men, have offered little support or advice when she has raised the issue.   Do you have any advice on dealing with this sort of harassment? She is occasionally alone during these encounters, so I worry about her safety, particularly if she were to call these men out. I also worry that she could face blowback in the form of lost contracts and retaliation from her own company.Work Advice: How I’m fighting sexism at the workplaceKarla: Wanda is caught in that classic Catch-22: trying to prove she should be regarded no differently from her male peers while having to work around obstacles none of her male peers are likely to encounter.Wanda’s employer is obligated to provide a safe working environment for all employees, and that extends to client interactions. If Wanda is concerned about her personal safety when conducting solo site visits, she should consider letting her managers and HR know that. They might propose a solution that offers her some backup without undermining her authority, such as having her bring a trainee along at no added cost to the client. But her employer might just decide that the easier solution is to pull her off site visits altogether.   But you’ve included a valuable nugget of information: “Generally, the culprits are those trying to cut corners.” When a client rep takes a swipe at her, she needs to immediately ask herself what he might be trying to distract her from, and pay even closer attention.Work Advice: I moved for his job, but my new job doesn’t move meWhen debriefing her bosses and colleagues after site visits, Wanda could present these incidents not as a complaint but as a litmus test: “When clients make cracks about me being young and female, it almost always turns out they’re trying to cover up noncompliance. The site foreman today made some jokes along those lines, and sure enough, I observed that the client had [cite deficiency].”By making the harassment incidental to the regulatory violation she’s been tasked with uncovering, Wanda makes it a work matter, not a personal one, and her youth and gender become a unique tactical advantage for sniffing out bad eggs.No, it’s not fair that she should have to minimize the gender bias she faces for fear that her ability to perform her job effectively might be called into question. But if a repeat client continues or escalates harassment on subsequent visits, she’ll have the history, credibility and standing to report the behavior itself."
7,"October 19, 2019","Reader: I work at a nonprofit with a mission I greatly support. I am a paid professional staff member working with a committee of volunteers. Most are lovely, but there is one I continually clash with. She is a critical person who seems to tell me everything the rest of us are doing wrong. While she knows the subject matter, her delivery leaves much to be desired; she makes demands rather than advising. I have gone out of my way to be diplomatic, but there is still tension. (She totally gave me the cold shoulder at a recent event.) She directs the group's energy away from assigned tasks to suit her own agenda. Now she's volunteered to be chair of this committee next year. This is a politically touchy situation, as I don't have the option of choosing or rejecting committee members.I need to figure out how I can work with her under these circumstances. Should I address this tension with her head on? Should I instead hold a meeting about general expectations for the committee? And how do I put my feelings away so that I can better discern whether she has a point or is overreaching? WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Even if you had power to “fire” her, nonprofits can seldom afford to lose dedicated volunteers or subject them to the kind of structured performance management for-profit employers use. Still, you are being paid to direct resources to meet the nonprofit’s goals, so you have some leverage. Let that ground you while you process the following questions:   Should I address tension head on? Yes, you should try to defuse this situation sooner rather than later. But at this point, the interpersonal tension seems less relevant than her observable behavior. Thus:Should I hold a meeting about general expectations? Yes, and her pending promotion is the perfect opportunity. If she’s going to be given authority, she also needs to be made aware of the corresponding responsibilities and limitations: “We have to ensure that use of resources can be directly traced to the organization’s purpose. That means being prepared to face challenges from leadership and the public on how we allocate volunteer hours. As committee chair, you’ll be under especially tight scrutiny.”How do I put my feelings away so that I can better discern when she might have a point? Some people just set our teeth on edge. But we can sometimes get past that if we know and trust their motives. Do you suspect she’s gunning for your paid position, or is she just a frustrated expert whose only agenda is being right? Do you trust that she’s trying to do right, albeit in the wrong way?   Then acknowledge her strengths, even the irritating ones — “She is passionate about the cause.” “She has a sharp eye for inefficiencies” — followed by the corresponding weaknesses: “She lacks diplomacy and patience.” “She tends to micro-focus on negatives and lose perspective on the broader priorities.” Keep that information to yourself, but use it to help you understand and anticipate her behavior.When interacting with her, give her space to explain (or fumble) her position: “I’m not seeing how doing it your way is better for our mission. Can you tell me more so I can justify it if we get pushback?” And give yourself space until your initial reaction to her settles down and your vision clears: “I hear what you’re saying. Let me get back to you on that.”When tension flares up, e.g. cold shoulders, address it without assumptions: “Is everything okay?”Finally, you mention clashing with this person but not whether her fellow volunteers appreciate her initiative or chafe at her imperiousness. Cultivate your own relationships with them and invite their feedback. As mentioned, your employer can’t afford to lose volunteers — and it certainly can’t afford to let another volunteer drive them out."
8,"October 26, 2019","Reader: I work at a nonprofit that is having serious financial difficulties. Recently a part-time employee was laid off. We had an awkward party, signed a card, said goodbye . . . and then she showed up to work again the following week in the same capacity but as an unpaid volunteer.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight In theory, this is until she finds new employment, but she enjoys the socialization in the office and does not have strong prospects for being employed elsewhere. Is this legal? Ethical? Just super bizarre?Karla: That’s a pretty neat trick your employer has pulled, getting a laid-off employee to come back and replace herself for no pay — possibly even under the fiction that this is actually doing the poor dear a favor.Story continues below  But the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, assuming it applies to your organization, might tell the story differently. The FLSA generally doesn’t allow private-sector employees to “volunteer” their labor doing jobs they were hired to perform, and it prohibits displacing paid workers for unpaid workers, such as interns or volunteers. Nonprofits get a bit more leeway, as many rely on volunteers to carry out charitable missions, but those volunteers are generally not supposed to perform commercial activities or jobs that would normally be done by paid employees of the nonprofit.AdvertisementEven if your now-unpaid colleague enjoys the social atmosphere at your workplace, it’s unclear how she can afford to go from gainful employment to volunteering. Perhaps she believes she is helping to keep a valued organization afloat through her sacrifice, or she figures even unpaid work is better than a gap in her work history. In any case, she appears unlikely to complain to anyone about the arrangement.But someone else could still tip off your state’s labor agency or the federal Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division, which might trigger some kind of investigation or audit. Since your organization was successful in cutting one payroll expense without a corresponding loss in productivity, “other workers may fear they’ll be next,” says Paula Brantner, CEO of PB Work Solutions.Story continues below  And Brantner alerted me to another twist: Even if your employer laid off this worker to avoid having to pay her, it could end up having to pay her indirectly later on. Certain nonprofits are allowed to opt out of paying state unemployment tax and instead pay out claims only when their former employees file for unemployment. If your volunteer qualifies for unemployment, the nonprofit could receive a bill from the state for the benefits she’s receiving. And if the unemployment office asks about her job-search efforts, and it comes to light that she’s working free of charge for her old employer, that could also lead to an uncomfortable line of questioning for your organization.AdvertisementIf this arrangement really is on the up and up, the organization should “have something in writing to verify the volunteer is doing this without pressure” and “going into this with his or her eyes fully open,” with no expectation of being paid or rehired, says employment attorney Declan Leonard of Berenzweig Leonard.Or it could shift your colleague from the work she’s doing now to a truly volunteer capacity, performing duties in service of its nonprofit mission. That would give her the social contact and résumé filler she needs while helping steer the nonprofit clear of legal issues — although, of course, it doesn’t resolve the issue of how the nonprofit can fill her old job at no additional cost."
9,"November 2, 2019","  My last name is uncommon and frequently misspelled — almost always in the same way, with two letters inverted. I work as a freelance writer, and when someone on an editorial staff types my name incorrectly into a byline, I only discover the mistake once the story is printed. Not only is it frustrating to see my work incorrectly credited, but I think it reflects poorly on me when my name is misspelled in my sample clips. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI already put my full name in multiple places on the manuscript, and, of course, it's in my email signature. I've started wondering if I ought to take a more proactive approach by saying something like: ""Just a heads-up: My name is very easy to misspell!"" when I send in a new piece. But that might just annoy an editor by suggesting that they wouldn't double-check an author's name. (Even though, obviously, some don't.) Any suggestions?Karla: I’m sure Hilary Swank, Saoirse Ronan and Chrissy Teigen feel your pain.   Since your livelihood probably depends on having your name show up correctly in Google, Amazon and library searches, I hope you consistently pursue publications to correct your byline wherever possible — and consider reserving your best pitches for publications you can trust to (1) spell contributors’ names right and (2) offer the courtesy of at least one pre-press review.As for how to prevent it from happening in the future: Once the same error pops up more than twice, you may as well make fixing it part of your brand. Think of presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg’s “BOOT EDGE EDGE 2020” campaign T-shirts. Or think of the bedding retailer phone number forever embedded in the public consciousness as “1-800-MATTRES — Leave off the last S for savings.” Whatever gimmicky mnemonic you can come up with, fashion it into a marketing hook and hang it on your email signature, your business cards and your online bio.Pro tip: If you’ve purchased a Web domain in your name, try to also purchase domains with common misspellings of your name and set them up to redirect visitors to the correctly spelled site.   And if you can come up with a mnemonic for Karla-with-a-K that doesn’t associate me with the monstrous serial killer of the same name, I’m all ears.It ‘makes you feel invisible’  I work in a small salon. My employer recently sent me a text reminding me to ""make sure you come in with your hair done, makeup on, and a bra on."" I've worked there for a year now and this is the first time she has told me I need to wear a bra. I've never signed any sort of dress code, and I feel that this text was sent only to me because I'm the only one there who doesn't wear a bra. I'm wondering if this is legal or if it could be discriminatory. I always make sure I'm covered; if I have a thin shirt on, I wear a bralette.Karla: As I’ve said before when discussing this topic from the management perspective, employers are generally allowed to set standards for employee attire — even gender-based requirements such as makeup if they don’t impose an “unequal burden” on one gender and as long as those standards are consistently applied and enforced. Having employees sign a written policy confirming they understand those standards is good insurance but not strictly necessary.Why not ask your boss for a frank explanation of why you going braless is a problem, and see if there are alternatives you would both be amenable to? If your boss can tell you’re the only one not wearing a bra, then it seems whatever you are wearing isn’t getting the job done.Work Advice: Can I tell my employee she has to wear a bra?"
10,"November 7, 2019","  I have an interview coming up for a part-time, temporary position until next summer. I just found out that I will need to move out of the area about four months from now, so I am also looking for shorter-term positions.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightWould you recommend telling the interviewer that I need to move in four months? Or would you recommend saying nothing, taking the job if offered and then just quitting when I have to move? I am concerned about future references. Also I just started a business relationship with someone who works at the company and who urged the interviewer to consider my résumé. I do not want to jeopardize that new relationship.Karla: Strictly speaking, you don’t owe the employer a detailed accounting of your plans, which could fall through next month for all you know. But you definitely shouldn’t squander a professional favor performed in good faith. Your existing connection outweighs any potential referral.   Inform your business associate that you’ve had an unexpected change of plans since applying for the job, and offer to withdraw your application, with many thanks for the opportunity. If your associate urges you to follow through with the interview anyway — maybe the job is portable? — you can do so with a clear conscience. Otherwise, a good-for-now job is a small sacrifice to make in exchange for a reference who can vouch for your integrity.  I have been with the same company for more than five years. I am hard-working and well-liked by my bosses. I am now applying to grad school and will need a reference from my employer. I am concerned that if I ask one of my current bosses, they will treat me differently knowing I will probably be leaving. Or worse, they may let me go before it's time to start school. What do you recommend I do?   Karla: In an ideal world, your bosses would be delighted to help you win an opportunity like this; at worst, they would urge you to consider continuing to work for them while earning your degree part-time.Again: “In an ideal world.” Here on planet earth, even in an ideal work environment, management hates to pay full price for someone with one foot out the door.The approach I’d recommend depends on your field of study. If you’re a paralegal going for an MFA in metalworking, maybe seek a referral from a discreet senior colleague outside your chain of command who can confirm what you’re like to work with — and keep it confidential.But if you’re pursuing an advanced degree related to your work, you probably want a referral from someone who can speak to your skills and subject-matter mastery — i.e., your supervisors.   If it’s early enough in the process — say, the referral deadline is months away — you could bring up grad school in casual conversation as a hypothetical you’ve been considering. The kind of response you get may tell you how open you can be about your application process and how likely your bosses are to terminate you prematurely.If it’s too late to put out feelers, you’ll just have to cross your fingers, make the request, and hope they have the perspective not to punish you for it. After all, career paths have a way of converging unexpectedly; you never know when the junior colleague you help boost professionally will someday be in a position to return the favor."
11,"November 14, 2019","  I’ve been a government contractor for 20 years. For the last nine years, I’ve had telecommuting privileges allowing me to work from home two days a week. On this contract, probably a quarter of us telecommute at least once a week. There’s starting to be grumbling in staff meetings among those who don’t have telecommuting privileges, and they are demanding it be offered or discontinued across the board. Managers get the deer-in-the-headlights look whenever the topic comes up. Should those of us who telecommute chime in during these protests with our medical, family and other personal justifications? Or should we say nothing and keep our fingers crossed?Karla: I’m guessing your employer doesn’t have a clear policy on telecommuting, or remote working — hence your managers’ stunned silence in response to the have-nots’ grumbling.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIn recent years, some large private employers and several federal government agencies — most recently, the Social Security Administration — have been cutting back on or eliminating programs that allowed people to work from home or work remotely, citing concerns about productivity and creative collaboration.   But while banning telecommuting might seem the simplest solution for your employer, it would damage morale among one-fourth of your company’s workforce and, if telework is being granted to accommodate a worker’s disability or other medical need, it could create legal problems.Also, employers seeking to attract and retain talent should be aware that job-seekers increasingly consider telework flexibility a standard requirement — not just a nice-to-have.But expanding remote working would probably generate some administrative headaches for your employer, especially when it comes to reporting client-billable hours and ensuring adequate on-site staffing and security. You have as much say in this debate as the grumblers, but trying to explain or justify individual arrangements tends to end in a heated debate over whose choices are more deserving: the parent with small children or the long-distance commuter who can’t afford to move closer.   Try advocating privately with colleagues and key players for a more productive dialogue: “Telecommuting definitely helps me perform my job better, and I can see why anyone would enjoy it. But I also understand concerns from the employer’s side. How can we start a discussion about ways to implement telework for more people, with reasonable and necessary guidelines?”  Two years ago, I moved with my husband from a large metropolitan area, where I was making a competitive salary with annual cost-of-living raises, to a city with a much lower cost of living. I was able to keep my job and work remotely earning the same salary.I have an opportunity for promotion to a position with more responsibility. I will be asking for more money, but I have a feeling they’ll say I’m already overpaid for my location. I’m curious what your take is on this.   Karla: My take is that you shouldn’t do your employer’s negotiating for them. They had the opportunity when you moved to cut your pay or say, “We’ll miss you, good luck” — but they decided it was worth it to them to keep paying you the same rate no matter where you’re doing the work.And more responsibility merits more pay — but once you bring up changing your pay, your employer might reasonably use the opportunity to bring up geographic pay differentials.Find a cost-of-living comparison calculator online, such as this one by staffing firm Robert Half. Figure out what raise you could expect if you were still in Bigbucksville, apply the cost-of-living rate to find out the equivalent salary in the city of Cheapsborough, and that gives you a reasonable negotiating range.Story continues below  You can always decline the promotion if the raise isn’t worth it to you, and the employer can promote someone else if your price isn’t worth it to them. Either way, you’re no worse off than you were before negotiations.Read more:Go ahead and interview for a new job -- but make plans for a graceful exit from your old oneHow do I respond to younger colleagues who make snarky comments about my age?HR vice president disparages own child with special needs at company meetings"
12,"November 21, 2019","  A friend of my college-age daughter is living with us. This kid works like a demon trying to save money for college. Just now she was in tears because her retail employer has once again scheduled her to work nine consecutive days. Some days are split shifts: She has to be there from 7:30 to 10 a.m. and then come back from 3 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. It doesn’t help that she’s recovering from oral surgery. What rights does she have?WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Under current U.S. law, not many. Unpredictable, erratic work schedules are a common complaint against retail and food-service employers who struggle to arrange employee shifts to match client demand without incurring overtime or pushing part-time workers into full-time status. The system fosters uncertainty and anxiety in an already marginalized sector of the workforce, many of whom are juggling multiple jobs, school and family responsibilities.Your young tenant may have some recourse if she lives in one of the growing number of states or cities that have instituted “fair workweek” laws requiring employers to provide ample notice of schedules and adequate rest time between shifts. (Some members of Congress — including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — have announced plans to reintroduce a bill, the Schedules That Work Act, to implement fair-workweek laws at the federal level.) Likewise, an increasing number of localities require employers to offer paid sick-leave days to workers so they can recover from illness or medical procedures without jeopardizing their income or jobs.   If she is lucky enough to live in an area that offers any of these protections, she can file a complaint with the state or local labor board. Edgar Ndjatou, executive director of employee advocacy group Workplace Fairness, advises that she and all workers keep their own personal records of hours worked, in case their employers’ recordkeeping is as erratic as their scheduling.  I am 80 years old and come from Venezuela. My concern for human rights, highly sensitized by events in my country, makes me wonder why in the United States, cashiers in stores, supermarkets, etc. need to be standing up. It seems to me that offering these workers a chair would improve their work conditions and prevent leg, feet and back problems.Karla: It seems to me that you are right. Even as office workers are embracing the concept of standing desks to improve health and posture, their retail counterparts who spend all day on their feet can tell you that too much standing is as detrimental to health as too little.   Pro tip: If you’re planning on dining out for Thanksgiving and perhaps taking advantage of Black Friday and Cyber Monday bargains, spare a thought and some patience for the cashiers, servers, call-center staff and warehouse workers putting in overtime to fulfill your desires.Speaking of overtime, it was around this time three years ago when a federal court abruptly blocked a Labor Department rule, under President Barack Obama’s administration, that would have nearly doubled to $47,476 the income threshold at which certain workers become exempt from overtime.The rule was finally struck down the following summer because it based overtime exemption on salary level without regard for job duties. But even opponents agreed the rule was long overdue for an update.Story continues below  The Labor Department, under President Trump, proposed a new overtime rule this spring and finalized it in the fall, raising the salary threshold from $455 per week ($23,660 per year) to $684 per week ($35,568 per year) and indicating that the threshold would be adjusted more regularly in the future.Note: Work Advice will be dark next week in celebration of pumpkin pie.Read more:My co-workers are grumbling about my remote working privilegesMaking labor demands after a new mom’s demanding laborThis employee thinks PTO is odious"
13,"December 5, 2019","Reader: My son finally found his perfect job in a high-pressure, professional customer service role, where he has gotten kudos from his customers and co-workers.An unfortunate incident recently occurred: A customer was splashed — through no fault of his — with hot coffee he was delivering, and he provided first aid. The next day, he contacted her via her LinkedIn page to thank her for her graciousness after the incident, and she filed a complaint with his employer for that. I don’t believe she complained about the accident, but she probably felt he overstepped by locating her on LinkedIn. It is a violation of company policy to contact customers through social media, and he was invited to resign in lieu of termination.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAt his first interview afterward, he was peppered with questions about this, and I fear it will be the same at all future interviews. He said he understands the importance of policies and has learned a valuable lesson — but how else can he keep this from derailing future job interviews?Carolyn Hax Live: There are no 'personal wormholes' to a better lifeKarla: Ouch, all around. Ironically, it sounds as though the accident wouldn’t have cost him his job, but for his follow-up.   Because the company offered him the option to resign, I suspect his former employer doesn’t intend to volunteer information to reference-seekers beyond “he resigned.” If he can verify that with his former HR department, then it’s up to him whether he divulges or omits his social media misstep in interviews. For example, he could say he wanted to go somewhere specifically offering [a feature the prospective company offers].Then again, having resigned without another job lined up could make him look impulsive and unreliable. And if he is uncomfortable delivering a just-true-enough explanation, a sharp interviewer will pick up on that discomfort.So that leaves the option of continuing to tell the truth, emphasizing the compassionate impulse — following up with an injured customer — behind his poor judgment call.   But I wonder: Does he understand what he did wrong? Beyond violating company policy, there’s an etiquette to social media that someone in customer service would do well to master.Any attempt to contact a stranger online should pass through four gates: consent, channel, context and cause. To wit: Do I have (1) this person’s consent to make contact (2) through this channel (3) in the context of our current relationship (4) for this cause?Here’s my breakdown:Reader’s son took it on himself to track down the customer, so he did not have her explicit consent to contact her.And even if, arguably, having an online presence means implicitly consenting to contact, LinkedIn — designed for professional networking — is not the appropriate channel for pursuing a personal matter.Story continues below  Next, every interaction he has had with her up to now has been in the context of customer service, representing his employer. Did he know whether his employer would have approved of his follow-up? Suppose the customer or her lawyer had read his message as an attempt to shush her, or as an admission of fault?AdvertisementFinally, even if he simply felt guilty and wanted to check on her well-being, that personal cause still doesn’t justify crossing the aforementioned boundaries.Bottom line: He can’t go wrong by assuming that any contact he initiates with customers outside the official channels and context of his job — from following on Facebook to asking for a date — is unwelcome.I don’t mean to harp. But understanding and taking to heart the broader context of his mistake is the key to showing that he truly has learned his lesson."
14,"December 12, 2019","  My son’s girlfriend is a waitress in a hotel restaurant in California. My son wants to bring her to meet our family at Christmas, but her manager has forbidden her to take time off. In 12 years, she has never been permitted to take time off during a major holiday. In fact, her time-off requests are frequently turned down even when it isn’t a holiday.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightA co-worker of hers who had been at the hotel for 30 years was fired after taking a short trip to her home country to help a relative through a crisis. Another co-worker had to forfeit thousands of dollars after being forced to cancel a nonrefundable vacation.Most of the employees are immigrants, and I think they are being exploited. Can hotel managers force employees to work all major holidays, year after year? Do managers have the right to fire employees who take time off when they’ve been told not to? My son’s girlfriend plans to come but is wondering whether she has any recourse if she gets fired.Online retailer puts office employees on mail-room duty through the holidaysKarla: At the federal level, and even in employee-friendly California, there are no laws requiring private-sector employers to grant employees paid or unpaid leave for holidays. Your son’s girlfriend might be entitled to time off as an accommodation for her religious beliefs — say, a few hours to attend a Christmas Eve service if she’s Christian — but probably not an extended trip for personal reasons.   If she can’t afford to lose her job over a family visit — and that sounds likely, given her employer’s track record — she may have to postpone travel until she can find a job that doesn’t force her to make that choice.In an ideal world, hospitality employers facing higher demand from (and charging higher prices to) holiday guests would channel those revenues into bonus wages as an incentive to workers who stay through the holiday. Or they could grant holidays on a rotating schedule. But if workers are too concerned about residency status or making ends meet to complain, or if there is a steady supply of replacement workers waiting in the wings, the employer probably figures it’s not worth the effort.Thanks to Allison West, principal at San Francisco consulting practice Employment Practices Specialists, for legal insights.      Please comment on the practice of employees collecting money from other employees to buy gifts for their bosses. This form of extortion can be particularly pernicious during the holiday season.Karla: In “Miss Manners Minds Your Business,” this exact practice is characterized as a “kickback.” If that isn’t sufficient comment, I’m not sure what I have to contribute to the conversation.If employees are so overcome with gratitude and warm feelings toward their bosses that they simply can’t help themselves, then any donations should be anonymous and voluntary, and the gift purchased with those donations should be presented as coming from the entire office, regardless of how much or whether they chipped in.Story continues below  If you’re looking for a practical way to decline, and you’re not in a public-sector job or other workplace with policies against upward gift-giving that you can cite, try a wide-eyed, “Oh, I read somewhere* that requiring people to buy holiday gifts for their bosses is improper.”*You read it here.

15,"December 19, 2019","Reader: I became a registered nurse in 2006. I have never worked harder or wanted anything more.In 2012, my father died and I suffered a work-related injury, all within six weeks. I became addicted to opiates and had my nursing license suspended. I self-reported and signed a contract with the state’s drug diversion committee. I have been clean and sober for almost five years, have remained compliant with the committee on impaired nurses and regained my state nursing license.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightHowever, I have struggled mightily to find a job. I have tried everything — being upfront on my cover letter, submitting professional letters of reference, not mentioning the suspension until the interview. I have no problem getting interviews, but as soon as I disclose my history, I can see the interviewers’ facial expressions change. I wonder if I should look into a different career, much as it breaks my heart. I don’t blame potential employers — I don’t know if I would hire a nurse with a history of license suspension. Do you have any advice?   Karla: I have thoughts, but nursing is such a specialized field that I’d like to consult some experts.Your story is an increasingly familiar one, says Beth Collis, an attorney with Dinsmore & Shohl in Columbus, Ohio, who represents medical professionals in licensing cases. As with many people caught up in the opioid epidemic, Collis says it’s not uncommon for nurses to become injured, have pain medication prescribed, and become dependent on the medication to help them work longer hours or deal with emotional pain.Although exact numbers can be hard to come by, Collis says more than half of the licensing cases she sees per year involve drug-related impairment, and the number has increased in the past 5 to 10 years. Larlene Dunsmuir, executive director of the Oregon Nurses Foundation, says Oregon’s state nursing board also reports an increase in disciplinary action for substance-use disorders, with estimates indicating impairment among 10 percent of nurses.   Even though you seem to have done all you can to overcome your addiction and clear your professional record, “health care does not have a culture of ‘second chances,’ ” says Dunsmuir. Collis notes that peers who view addiction as a character deficit rather than a disease can be judgmental.The good news is, says Collis, “all of my clients find work again.” You may have to take a strategic detour from your original path, but you shouldn’t have to leave nursing altogether.First, accept that some doors will be closed to you. Collis notes that hospices and short-term contract agencies, for example, simply cannot risk hiring nurses with a history of impairment.Story continues below  So you need to focus on lower-risk environments that welcome your experience. Collis and Dunsmuir recommend mental health facilities, dialysis and plasma centers, phone advice positions, nursing education and case management as options where your history should be less of a concern and there will be fewer opportunities for relapse; addiction treatment centers in particular may see your history as an asset in relating to patients.AdvertisementAbove all, you should get comfortable with telling your story briefly and honestly, as you did in your letter. “If you have a story to tell, it’s best to tell it in person, and it’s best to have a personal contact who can make a personal reference,” says Collis. She also recommends sticking with your recovery program even after you land a job: “That first year will be the hardest time.”For what it’s worth, I say your recovery shows strength of character, and your struggles make you a wiser, more compassionate caretaker. Employers who can see that will know you have a lot to offer. Best of luck in your continued personal and professional recovery.Pro tip: Many states offer “alternative to discipline” programs to monitor and support health-care professionals with substance-abuse issues; the National Organization of Alternative Programs (alternativeprograms.org) publishes a member list with links to a variety of state programs."
16,"December 26, 2019","Looking back over 2019 and the issues readers have entrusted me with, I realize most of them revolve around one concept: boundaries. How to set them, how to respect them, how to enforce them.Readers sought advice on protecting physical-space boundaries tested by colleagues who are smelly, flirty or simply too affectionate. With open-space floor plans eliminating literal barriers at work, it’s no wonder telecommuting is such an in-demand perk.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightOn a more abstract level, readers struggled to set boundaries to protect their mental space against demanding colleagues, clients and workloads. Occasionally, readers needed help finding ways to keep personal issues from intruding on professional mental space. Sometimes that means enforcing hierarchical boundaries, even if it goes against human impulses.   On the clock, readers had to defend their time against meandering meetings and needy networkers. Off the clock, moms and dads protected the perimeters around their families. Leisure time for everyone is increasingly fleeting and fragmented, especially in service industry and freelance jobs, with technology constantly poking holes in the boundary.Workers in marginalized demographics fought to overcome the  of bias and draw their own lines on unacceptable behavior from colleagues and clients, from idea theft to disparaging comments and other forms of disrespect.Compensation questions highlighted the constant negotiation over the boundary between the skills and effort an employer can demand and the wages and benefits employees can demand in exchange.Story continues below  While laws and policies set some boundaries for workers, the rest is up to us and our economic needs, life situations, ambitions, health and personality. Here’s hoping the new year brings the stability and resources each of us needs to establish healthy boundaries that will allow us to be more open and compassionate toward one another.Advertisement==Let’s tie things up with reader updates on how workers are enforcing — or softening — their own boundaries:From the nonprofit manager facing off against a prickly volunteer (Oct. 20): The good news is that we seem to have figured out how to shift from an adversarial relationship to one that is more collaborative. I think we both did some ego shifting. For now, it’s a good working situation.Story continues below  From the letter writer asking about a server who hadn’t had Christmas off in 12 years (Dec. 15): In the end, my son’s girlfriend managed to get the time off, but her supervisor made it clear that she’d better not make any similar requests in the foreseeable future. The good news: this ordeal has motivated her to work on getting her real estate license.From a reader commenting on the column about the worker fired for contacting a customer on LinkedIn (Dec. 8): AdvertisementI use an app that has a social component showing other users’ names and photos. I’ve been considering starting a project involving interviews with other users of this app whose email I can figure out based on their profiles. To me, it feels completely innocuous and might lead to an outcome that could be interesting and positive for all concerned. And yet.Your column made me realize that “might” and “could” and “to me” isn’t good enough, and that technology is changing these unwritten rules quickly. Just because I can contact someone with an “out of band” communication doesn’t mean I should. I think your “four gates” model is really useful, and I intend to adopt it."
17,"January 2, 2020","  I am a licensed clinical social worker working for a nonprofit community mental health center. My agency has been contracted by the local jail to run an in-jail substance abuse treatment program, which I supervise. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightInmates are segregated by sex, with separate housing units for males and females. Some of these units are “open cell blocks,” where inmates are housed in a large, gymnasium-like room that has separate areas for eating, sleeping, showering and using the bathroom. All these areas are exposed with limited privacy. Correctional officers are assigned to these housing units by gender, so that only male officers oversee male inmates and only female officers oversee female inmates.Our substance abuse program’s group therapy sessions take place in the open cell block units, which means that the jail requires a female counselor for the women and a male counselor for the men — a requirement I support not just for the inmates’ dignity and privacy, but for therapeutic reasons.   Our agency has been struggling to fill a vacant position for a counselor to work with the male inmates. Under these unique circumstances, is there any way to legally advertise for a male clinician that would not run afoul of employment nondiscrimination laws?Karla: Ordinarily, posting a job ad that asks specifically for male candidates would look like a textbook example of illegal sex discrimination. But there is a narrow exception under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for “bona fide occupational qualifications” when  the trait in question is “reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business.” As you can see with the jail’s same-sex officer assignments, this exception is “very common in prison situations” when inmates’ privacy is at issue, says Amy Epstein Gluck, employment law partner at FisherBroyles.In your case, according to Epstein Gluck, if you can provide evidence that a counselor’s sex is “reasonably necessary to the essence of the job” and “there is no better ‘proxy’ (job qualification) for an employee to effectively perform the requirements of the position” — and if no alternative location besides the sex-segregated cell blocks is available for conducting group therapy — then you would seem to have a pretty solid argument for specifically hiring the best man for the job.   Epstein Gluck notes that you’ll want to word the job ad carefully, making clear that the position you’re advertising serves male inmates in an open environment where privacy is a concern. Paying an HR consultant or employment attorney for an hour of their time to review your phrasing might be a worthwhile investment.  I’m looking for some help with how to craft email salutations to recipient lists that are mixed company or all-female. An Internet search of whether “Hey guys” is gender neutral was inconclusive. Anyway, it feels wrong, especially to an all-female group. I could ditch the salutation altogether, but that can make certain emails come across as terse. Writing out everyone’s name is impractical. Any advice?Karla: Just know you’re seeking advice from someone who addresses her own mother as “Dude.”   Fortunately, gender-neutral but still personable identifiers abound, from the nondescript (Everyone/Everybody, Team, All) to the folksy (Folks, Y’all or the explicitly plural All Y’all, Gang) to the cheerfully ludicrous (Esteemed Colleagues, Comrades, Dearly Beloved).Pro tip: Even with an all-female or all-male recipient group, steer clear of gendered greetings (Ladies, Gents, Gals, Fellas) unless gender is the group’s primary focus."
18,"January 9, 2020","As alert online readers are quick to point out, I’m not a legal expert. I’m just a keyboard jockey with a sympathetic ear and a tongue-in-cheek perspective on interpersonal conflict. Sometimes the most helpful advice I can offer is to go straight to an employment lawyer.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightSpoiler alert: That’s exactly what I’m telling this week’s readers to do.  When the [Barack] Obama administration proposed to raise the overtime threshold to $47,476 in 2016, our employer changed many of us from salaried to hourly status. My office likes having hourly employees log in and out of the office for work, breaks and lunch to track our time; we did not have to do this as salaried employees. Working overtime is rarely allowed, so changing to hourly status did not benefit us at all. Even though this rule was blocked and then struck down, our employer kept us hourly.   Under the new, lower overtime threshold of $35,568 adopted in September 2019 that just took effect, many of us would qualify for salaried status again, yet our employer has not mentioned changing us back. Do we have any recourse under the new rule to be returned to salaried status?Karla: The problem with using the terms “salaried” and “hourly” is that it oversimplifies how employees are treated under the Fair Labor Standards Act; the more precise, if confounding, terms are “exempt” and “nonexempt.” The difference between exempt-salaried and nonexempt-hourly status isn’t a simple dollar amount. It also depends on the type of work you do and other criteria. If you want to argue that you qualify for exempt-salaried status, you’ll need help from a legal expert who understands all the factors involved.Bear in mind that even if you qualify for exempt-salaried status, your employer can still elect to keep you classified as nonexempt-hourly. In that case, your lawyer can advise you of your rights as a nonexempt-hourly worker, such as not being allowed to perform unpaid work during breaks or outside business hours.     I am in my 50s and have worked for decades as an employee for a large firm. I have been invited to continue performing the same functions I perform now, but as an independent contractor. I will lose all benefits and receive an hourly wage instead of a salary. If I do not accept, I have been told I must leave. Is this legal?Karla: The Department of Labor, the IRS and a growing number of states (most recently California ) take a dim view of employers that try to classify employees as independent contractors to avoid paying benefits and taxes.I’m not qualified to say whether that’s what’s happening in your case. But you know who is qualified? Yep: A lawyer can determine whether your employer seems to be pulling an illegal bait-and-switch with your status, or making a defensible business decision to significantly scale back and outsource the work you’ve been performing — even whether you might be a target of age discrimination.   Even if this change is on the up and up, a lawyer’s support could come in handy. If you come back as a contractor, you’ll want to negotiate a new contract with adequate pay to cover your out-of-pocket costs and provisions to ensure you remain independent. If you’d rather leave, you might want help negotiating a departure that leaves you eligible to collect unemployment benefits.Unlike writing to a columnist, consulting a lawyer is rarely cost-free. But an hour with a lawyer can keep you from forgoing money you’re legally entitled to — or wasting more time and money pursuing a lost cause. Pro tip: For leads on legal advice for low-income individuals, contact your state’s bar association or visit Legal Aid.

19,"January 16, 2020","Last December, I was a classic burnout case. The closer I came to the year-end holidays, the harder it became to muster the enthusiasm and satisfaction I usually find in my day job. Physically exhausted and emotionally flattened, I sputtered and skidded across the finish line, posted my out-of-office auto-reply and logged off for an extended holiday break. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightSound familiar? If you’ve ever gone through a period at your job when you’ve felt fried, drained, paralyzed, purposeless, “unable to even” or “just Over It,” then you’ve probably experienced burnout.The World Health Organization last year included burnout in its international classification of diseases as a widespread “occupational phenomenon” characterized by depletion or exhaustion, negative feelings or cynicism about one’s job, and reduced effectiveness at work. According to Gary Beckstrand, vice president of the O.C. Tanner Institute, most workers experience some degree of burnout at any given time — but when burnout reaches moderate-to-severe levels, “that’s when it affects production, attitudes, work output and retention.”   Burnout takes many forms. Maybe you robotically force yourself through the motions, hunkering down and dodging human interaction to minimize distractions and conserve energy. Maybe you cry in private, or snap and snarl, or demolish your professional facade with sweary outbursts. You feel no urgency about even crucial projects; you see no end-game. And when you do complete a project, there’s no sense of accomplishment or relief — just another pile of work to climb on top of.Five ways freelance writers can fight burnoutBurnout isn’t necessarily due to a heavy workload or long hours; hard workers can be happy workers in the right conditions. And occasional short-term burnout is normal for humans, a sign we need a break. But in the case of chronic, pervasive burnout, Beckstrand says, the primary cause is usually a “negative workplace culture” with deficiencies in six areas: purpose, opportunity, success, appreciation, well-being and connection. To combat employee burnout, says Beckstrand, employers should make a regular practice of acknowledging workers for their unique contributions as individuals, and helping them feel connected to a larger purpose.But it’s not all on management to prevent burnout. Beckstrand recommends that workers take burnout as a sign to seek meaningful contact from supervisors and peers — not just to complain or vent, but to admit when they’re stuck, ask for input and seek a broader perspective on how their work supports the overall mission.   Recognizing personal burnout may be tricky in a perpetually high-stress job; if you’re constantly putting out fires, you might not notice when your sleeves are getting singed. But if you, or those around you, are seeing symptoms described above — especially if it’s out of character for you — take heed.Assess the scope of damage: Is your burnout temporary, or a longer-term state-of-being causing cumulative harm? Is it cyclical and predictable, or has it been triggered by an organizational shake-up that has left you scrambling to do more with less? Have you just looked up and realized you’ve been traveling the same worn oval track with no destination or even milestones?In my case, I recovered from burnout by baking, gift-giving and tackling other homey holiday projects with my favorite little teammates. I also traveled to my hometown to connect with old friends from decades past. And in the first week post-holidays, my office kicked things off with an all-hands Q&A with executive leadership to discuss the outlook for the coming year, which helped remind me that my daily toil is part of something bigger.   Of course, I had the advantage of knowing my burnout was seasonal and short-term. I also enjoy access to resources such as paid time-off, mental and physical health care, loving family and friends, and a workplace that makes healthy culture a priority. For too many burned-out workers, such resources are luxuries, and the challenges are more than a few dozen ginger snaps and pecan tarts can alleviate.Next week: Exploring reader experience with burnout."

With what he left me, I could take a lower-paying job or even stop working for a while and make up the difference with my inheritance. Is it completely taboo to quit one's job before looking for another one? I could explain time off as needing time to settle my father's affairs. I'm 55 and female, so I don't want to sabotage my job prospects. What is your opinion? Karla: Unlike seasonal burnout, which often responds to quality time off,  your chronic burnout seems to call for bigger changes. But mid-burnout is precisely when you shouldn’t impulsively decide to quit — not because it’s taboo, but because it’s impractical. As you alluded, the further along in your career you are when you step off the hamster wheel — even for legitimate reasons like illness or bereavement — the harder it becomes to climb back on. And once your inheritance runs out, what then?   You do need a break. But rather than cut yourself completely adrift, why not see if you can buy yourself some time off from your job — using banked PTO or unpaid leave padded with some of your inheritance — to think about how your inheritance might remove the obstacles or mitigate the obligations driving you toward burnout? For example, could it help you:— move— fund regular, restorative trips— afford training to update your skills or explore new interests— eliminate your mortgage or other financial burden— pay for career counseling?In the end, quitting your job may be the only solution. But at least you will have reached that conclusion through deliberation rather than desperation, with a map in hand.Read Karla's advice on workplace dramas and traumas  I was let go from a project management job. I was unhappy and burned out in that role. I accept responsibility for my poor performance. I have a solid work history otherwise. During my previous years with this same company I excelled on a project team. I understand that I am not a queen bee and am better suited as a worker bee.   I am overwrought with anxiety at interviews. When asked why I left, I choke. When I mention a mutual parting of ways, the interviewer starts digging. Is there an appropriate way to address my termination? Karla: This is why it’s crucial to recognize and address burnout before it drags you down. And now you need to do the same with your anxiety.“It wasn’t a good fit” should suffice — but you still have to be prepared for follow-up questions without sounding like you’re making excuses. “I’m better suited as a worker bee” seems humble and straightforward — but it’s a little too humble, verging on a cop-out.You were burned out and underperforming. Why? Was it a lack of experience or failure to seek guidance on your part? A failure of leadership on your employer’s? Internal or external obstacles that only a seasoned manager might have dodged? Was the job completely at odds with your skills and strengths?A sympathetic former manager may be willing to help you perform a postmortem and create a narrative that shifts focus from what didn’t work out in the past to what would in the future: “It wasn’t a good fit; my best contributions have come from roles that made use of my XYZ skills, which is why your advertised position interests me.”"
21,"January 30, 2020","Reader: Five years ago, I reconnected with a fellow graduate through an online dating site. He complained nonstop about his then-job. I didn’t see a romantic spark, but invited him to stay in touch because there might be an opening for him at my federal workplace. About a year later, he was hired after I sang his praises to the hiring panel. We used to spend a lot of time together, hitting the gym after work and being each other’s confidants.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightHe said some things after he was hired that suggested he was disappointed I didn’t choose to date him. I was the last to hear when he got engaged.Now our supervisor is retiring, creating a promotion opportunity that I've been waiting on for a decade. My co-worker has been acting weird since the announcement, launching into soapbox speeches of changes he wants. I changed my gym hours because hanging out with him has become unbearable.   I’ve learned he is also applying for the promotion. I saw it coming, and I know he must have felt too awkward to tell me himself, but I hate that I heard it from someone else. At the gym, we used to discuss the future of our department, always under the understanding that I was the logical choice for supervisor. He used to ask a lot of questions about what I would change. Now I feel like I can’t trust him. Any advice?Karla L. Miller offers weekly advice on workplace dramas and traumas. You can send her questions at work.advice.wapo@gmail.com.Karla: I included your short-lived dating history not just because it makes a nifty Valentine’s Day hook, but also because it offers context about how you two communicate (or don’t) and what you can expect from him going forward.Your history indicates he’s happy to receive the information and favors you willingly supply, but keeps his own cards close to his vest. Despite all the time you’ve spent together, much of what you know about him seems to be based in inferences, assumptions and hearsay. Maybe he’s just reserved in general, but I think you have to consider that there may be a strategic purpose to his reticence — i.e., while you thought you had a bridge partner, he’s been playing poker.   For example, complaining about his job won your sympathy and got you to open doors for him; telling you about his engagement would have generated no similar benefit. And if he knew he was interested in the promotion even as he was encouraging you to spill your ideas, then he was treating you as a competitor while you were treating him as a confidant.Of course, just because you recruited him doesn’t mean he should automatically step back and “let” you have the promotion. And you don’t indicate what makes you the “logical” successor besides seniority and patience. Finally, your cutting off communication makes his failure to give you a heads-up about his plans into a chicken-or-egg situation.But what’s done is done. Now the question becomes how you will deal with whatever decision is eventually announced. One or the other of you is bound to be disappointed, perhaps bitterly, at the hand you’re dealt.   Whether through skills or schmooze appeal, if he gets promoted, will you be able to respect his position?And if you are the one promoted, history suggests he’ll withdraw and make comments to indicate his disappointment at not being chosen. Can you trust him at your table?Before the announcement, you can make one last attempt to lay your cards on the table and invite him to do the same: “I know both of us applying for the supervisor’s job makes things kind of awkward. Whatever happens, I hope we can agree to have each other’s back.” In the meantime, work on your poker face.Read more:When the boss ‘hears’ men in the office — but not womenA reading list for millennial women as they launch their careers"
22,"February 6, 2020","Reader: It recently became obvious that a co-worker was spending two to four hours out of each day texting and shopping online using the company computer and her personal cellphone. At the same time, management told me to “lean in” to help another co-worker with an increased workload. I asked if Shopping Co-Worker might be a better choice based on time availability, to which I was told that supporting Swamped Co-Worker was part of my job. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightWhen I brought up that Shopping Co-Worker was spending a lot of time not working, I was told it was none of my business; I should focus on my job. It’s increasingly frustrating that my work is suffering based on my additional load while Shopping Co-Worker checks Facebook, browses potential clothing and car purchases, reads texts, etc. At what point is a co-worker stealing wages “none of my business” — if ever — and how do you put on a résumé that you’re seeking another job because management seems too dim to understand how theft of wages affects morale?Three questions to ask when you feel resentful towards a co-workerKarla: Not to be a simpering semanticist, but if management is content to pay your colleague to convert surplus oxygen to CO2, then she can hardly be accused of stealing her own wages. There’s a distinct difference between cadging from the cash drawer and putting in what an onlooker deems to be a subpar level of effort.   But I take your point. It does destroy morale when workers are being asked to shoulder an unfair portion of the workload while they can see colleagues slack-a-lackin’. And if you suspect this unequal distribution of duty systemically burdens workers of a specific gender, race, age group, etc., that’s a matter for HR or even a lawyer.But since you’ve raised your concerns and been advised to drop the matter, that’s precisely what I recommend you do. If it helps, you can tell yourself (and only yourself) a story about why the not-so-secret shopper is being allowed to get away with it. Maybe she’s unwell. Maybe she completes work in microbursts when you’re not watching. Maybe she’s so incompetent that assigning her tasks creates more work for everyone else. Maybe she’s paddling harder than is visible on the surface. Maybe management is building the case to declare her redundant. Whether she’s a charity case or a leech, none of those scenarios requires further intervention from you. And the more you lean over into someone else’s business, the more unbalanced you become.Tell us how you handle lazy co-workers.What is your business, and where you need to center your focus, is your own performance and compensation. If your increased workload is dragging you down, ask your manager to help you prioritize. State the problem without presuming to prescribe the solution.   Train your powers of observation on tracking your own progress. Update your manager and Swamped Co-Worker frequently — via email, so it’s in writing — on what you’ve completed. That record may be useful in making a case for more money come review time, or it may help you assemble a portfolio of accomplishments when the time comes to look elsewhere.Speaking of which: If you decide to explore sunnier prospects, don’t bring shade with you.

23,"February 12, 2020","Reader: I work for a large health-care organization in a rural area. I do not work in direct patient care, but manage a health-information department in a building off-site. In 2015 I had a significant reaction to a mandatory influenza vaccine and was ill for two months. My primary care provider, an orthopedic joint specialist, and a rheumatologist all recommended I no longer receive an influenza vaccine. My employer exempted me from getting the vaccine for three years, no questions asked. I just had to wear a mask while working. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightLast year, my employer said I had to see their in-house allergy and immunology specialist, who denied me the exemption. I saw another allergy and immunology specialist in a large metropolitan city, who said I definitely should not get the influenza vaccine, ever. At that point my choices were to risk getting the influenza vaccine, or resign my job of 30 years. The specialist I saw in the city is also an attorney, and he thought what they were doing was illegal. What is your take on this? I feel the risks outweigh any benefits given the low efficacy rates of the influenza vaccine.Get a grip America. The flu is a much bigger threat than coronavirus for now.Karla: Like wearing a hazmat suit to the office, your last sentence is overkill. By bringing up efficacy, you’re inviting debate over whether flu vaccines are generally beneficial, which experts generally agree they are.   So let’s back up and home in on your relevant facts: Multiple medical professionals have recommended you avoid vaccination because of your medical history. Also, you’ve established a precedent with your employer for being able to safely perform your job with reasonable accommodations.Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, employers must accommodate qualified employees with disabilities that prevent them from getting vaccinated, unless that accommodation creates an undue hardship for the employer, according to Amy Epstein Gluck, an employment attorney at FisherBroyles. There may be room for debate over what constitutes “disabilities” and “undue hardship,” but if letting you work in a mask wasn’t a hardship for your employer in the past few years, why should it be now?Epstein Gluck recommends asking your specialist for “thorough documentation of the medical need for the exemption” and then presenting that information to your employer to make your case for reasonable accommodations.   The ADA doesn’t prevent an employer from requiring employees to see a medical provider of its choice, but as Epstein Gluck notes, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cautions against the employer relying solely on that medical provider’s opinion when it’s contradicted by the employee’s health-care provider.Considering your history and your doctor’s support, your employer should be willing to consider flu-prevention options besides submitting or quitting. If not, you might want to consult one more specialist: an employment attorney.Pro tip: Even in a pandemic, EEOC guidelines recommend that employers subject to the ADA encourage, not require, employees to get the flu vaccine.Karla L.

25,"February 27, 2020","Reader: I teach part time for a nonprofit art center. Our educational supervisor has strongly recommended that we begin each new class by stating our own personal pronouns, and then having students state theirs. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI find this intrusive, so I simply told my class that if anyone is uncomfortable with the pronouns I am using for them — or anything else about the class — they can email or tell me in private. This went over like a lead balloon. Blank stares, eye rolls, and a few “You-have-got-to-be-kidding-me’s.” I checked with other teachers, who told me they just ignored the request.In a recent staff meeting, when the supervisor asked how it was going, I spoke up honestly but kindly. That also went over like a lead balloon. The supervisor got flustered and said she thought it was important that everyone feel comfortable. When I mentioned that it had the opposite effect in my classes, she said it was up to us to educate students about gender fluidity and trans awareness. I disagree. That is not part of our mission statement.   In my decades of teaching art in different situations, I have a reputation for welcoming everyone. One transgender student told me mine was the most welcoming class they had ever taken.I don’t depend on this job for a paycheck. Quitting is an option. What would you recommend?Karla: Why would you quit? Your supervisor’s priorities seem to align with what you say is your reputation for making everyone feel respected and welcome. In social, academic and professional settings, offering one’s personal pronouns — he/him, she/her, they/them, ze/zir — is an increasingly common way to do that. It indicates awareness that not everyone is comfortable having society assign them to a pink or a blue box.Story continues below  Unfortunately, your supervisor’s efforts seem to be having the opposite effect — not just for  people who didn’t expect their color theory lessons to include discussion on the gender spectrum, but also for people who aren’t ready to “out” themselves to strangers. And instructors whose discomfort or insincerity shows through during the exercise could cause more harm than good.A grammar nerd gently dismantles those arguments for rejecting the new 'they'Nor do I endorse barging ahead with your own assumptions and putting the onus on students to set you straight; how many of us balk at correcting others, especially those in authority, who call us by the wrong name? Better to offer your own pronouns and leave it to students whether they want to follow suit.   Not that I have any easy answers. I myself resisted the singular “they” for years until I realized it was not about grammar, but about making a respectful statement in an imperfect, inadequate tongue.Still, is it not the purpose of art to challenge default thinking? For that matter, why put non-binary people or gender nonconformists on the spot when each aspect of human identity — race, ability, sexuality, happiness, health — exists on a spectrum?Surely someone with decades of experience creating welcoming environments can come up with creative exercises and assignments to incorporate inclusion into a curriculum. And instead of bucking or butting heads with your supervisor, maybe you could start a dialogue with her on other ways to accomplish that.Story continues below  Of course, you may encounter pushback from anyone primed to see a political agenda in every gesture of inclusion.

The benefits and remote status were enticing, although the pay was below the median. I thrived under intense pressure in grad school, so I was up for the challenge.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI’m expected to complete intellectually challenging projects designed to take seven hours per day, plus an hour of administrative tasks. We all have deadlines, but the work can’t be rushed or it won’t meet quality targets, which the company tracks. I typically work from 8:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. and often later. Eight months in, I’m always sick, consumed with anxiety, and I’ve never been more tired. Co-workers have admitted to crying or falling asleep at their desks. Turnover is high, but you don’t hear about it; you just realize you haven’t seen someone online for a while and then notice that they’ve been wiped from all interfaces.    Many employees are parents who work seven days a week but fewer hours per day so they can be with their kids. The company has won awards for being “family friendly” and talks a big game about its focus on wellness.Is this normal? Did grad school give me a false sense that I knew the true meaning of hard work?Karla: Let’s start by unpacking “the true meaning of hard work.” It’s an overblown concept that’s due for deflating.Anything that takes effort is work. Depending on your skills, situation and natural inclination, some work is going to feel more like hard work than other kinds. Some runners excel at sprints; others excel at distance.

It takes time to adapt to its routines and rhythms, learning when to put in maximum effort or conserve resources. Human minds and bodies are designed to find that balance and settle into a sustainable groove. If you’re constantly spinning your wheels without finding your groove, something is out of alignment.The effort-to-reward ratio matters. Parents going through little-kid boot camp may welcome the trade-offs of a job with no commute and no set hours.

Does that mean you can’t hack a little hard work?AdvertisementUnder any productivity model, regular 11-hour days of intense concentration are simply unsustainable, even if you spend  them in your pajamas or spread them over your weekend. Your weeping, exhausted colleagues indicate you’re far from the exception. Either management is unaware of how out of sync the work is with its wellness goals, or the churn-and-burn business model is by design.In overworked Japan, Microsoft tested a four-day workweek. Productivity soared.My take: If Upton Sinclair wrote science fiction, your workplace sounds like something he’d have come up with: a brain-powered assembly line designed for maximum efficiency and uniform quality, with minimum human interaction, where those who can’t keep up drop out and are replaced like stripped screws. The family-friendly awards and pro-wellness party line add the perfect dystopian twist.Run your own race, seek your groove, weigh your rewards.

It is making me tense and anxious. I don’t know what to say because often I have no idea why she is unhappy. She is past her probationary period and is in a union, so I can’t let her go. How do you tell an employee to grow up?Karla: You say yourself that you “have no idea why she’s unhappy.” To that I would add: “Or if.”   Just for fun, use your smartphone or your laptop webcam to snap a selfie right now, without changing your expression. Set alarms to remind you to keep doing this throughout your workday. Chances are, you look like you’re angry or annoyed  when you’re really just sleepy, on a conference call or focusing on work. And unless “presenting a cheery and pleasing facade” is in your job description, you probably wouldn’t want your bosses judging your performance on that basis.You also say she’s “capable and likes to work.” If that’s true, then her scowl could be due to performance anxiety. I have known enough sensitive, self-critical people who have been told they look “mean” that I think we all could use a reminder about books and covers.Finally, make sure you’re not indulging some unconscious bias about what young female colleagues are supposed to look like.

And it’s on you, as her boss, to help her improve that performance.   If she’s rude to colleagues, verbally or through huffing/eye rolls/passive-aggressive foot-dragging, that merits a conversation.If her job involves creating a welcoming and hospitable space, but she’s falling short, you could say: “You’re the first impression our clients receive when they come to our office. We need you to make an extra effort to make them feel welcome.”And if she confirms that her dour demeanor is due to critiques and corrections: “Everyone needs to make improvements, and no one enjoys hearing it. But if you take it this hard and beat yourself up whenever someone says something, people will avoid talking to you about things that need improving. That could hold you back, and you’ll never know why.” Of course, that kind of frank feedback goes down better when it’s periodically supplemented with praise for the things she gets right.   But suppose she is a perpetual pouty-puss, radiating bad vibes like a malfunctioning microwave oven. People like that exist, and they are exhausting to be around.If all else fails, a layer of consistent neutrality — or even cheer — is a powerful pout repellent. Expressing concern — “Is everything all right? You seem out of sorts” — can gently alert someone that their face has gone rogue.Bonus: If something really is bothering her, and she trusts you, you may learn something important.

My office and his share a wall, and his behaviors are audible and disturbing.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightRichard often talks loudly to himself using various voices. Abrupt shrieking or Joker-style laughter erupts from his office. He has some kind of stomach issue and often belches loudly. There’s more, but you get the idea. Our manager constantly talks to him about keeping the noise down. It only lasts a couple of hours. Recently, most of our team moved upstairs for a temporary project. Richard and I remained. With the manager upstairs, Richard is noisier than ever.Story continues below  I've asked if I can move, but our managers don’t want Richard left alone.AdvertisementI know he can’t help some of this; colleagues with knowledge about autism think he’s on the spectrum. But I’ve been stuck with the worst of it for more than two years, because I’m the oldest on the team by about 20 years and presumably more patient and mature (this has been verbalized to me). Any advice?Karla: If Richard’s outbursts are because of neurodiverse wiring, it’s great that your managers are supportive. But making him your problem is not the answer, especially if they’re basing that decision on assumptions about you as an older worker. Imagine fobbing him off on a female colleague because “women are naturally more tolerant and nurturing.”Story continues below  But you don’t need a diagnosis to know that he’s disrupting your ability to do your job. If you haven’t yet, you need to make that exact point to your managers. If he can’t be left alone, press for specifics on what your presence is supposed to accomplish. Are you supposed to monitor him? Do you have the authority to talk to him as your manager does?Work Advice: How has your work changed because of the coronavirus outbreak?Are they concerned his behavior will escalate, and they need you there to intervene if it does? That might seem overblown, but raising these questions might drive home just how much of an imposition they’re laying on you. And if riding herd on Richard is now part of your job, that change needs to be formalized.AdvertisementIf they agree you shouldn’t be his keeper, remind them you still need a buffer against his behavior: relocating, telecommuting or sound-canceling headphones. You might as well go ahead and get the headphones now, while anyone who might object is sitting upstairs.Story continues below    I work in a small office (fewer than 20 people). Another professional in the office is constantly making noise. He sniffs, he snorts, he burps, he groans. Sometimes he says, “Excuse me,” but I’m not sure he is even aware of how noisy he is. Group meetings are a trial. I try to sit as far as possible from him, but I find all his sound effects nauseating. If I say anything to our boss, am I just going to look petty?Karla: Even if you complain to the boss, it’s not certain that the office Jabberwocky will or can self-regulate his whiffling and burbling, whether because of respiratory or gastric conditions, neurological tics or simply an upbringing among warthogs.AdvertisementBut unlike Reader 1, you needn’t even identify the disruptive person to justify creating a distraction-free zone for yourself with, for example, noise-canceling headphones. If your boss asks, you could say: “I really need these to help me focus on work.”Story continues below  Being exposed to his cacophony in meetings, I’m sorry to say, is probably unavoidable under ordinary conditions. But to tie this back to the present situation: Once the worst of the coronavirus pandemic has passed, weeks of social distancing may leave managers with less appetite for in-person meetings than they once had — and less tolerance for disruptive people.Read more:Work advice: Coughing co-workers are driving me crazy Work advice: Oh no!

If those arguments aren’t persuasive enough, employment law partner Amy Epstein Gluck at FisherBroyles offers legal considerations:Story continues below  In addition to the ADA’S “reasonable accommodations” provisions, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration protects “employees who reasonably believe they are in imminent danger” if they come to the workplace.Employees can’t legally be fired if they qualify to take unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act to recover or care for family members. What’s more, those rights were recently enhanced by the newly enacted federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which requires many employers to provide additional paid sick and family leave and broadens access to family leave.AdvertisementBut legal liability is kind of beside the point. Employers shouldn’t be worrying about how to legally get the most bang for their buck out of jittery employees. They should be focused on minimizing the strain on public resources and keeping their workers and workplaces as safe as possible.Story continues below  Many employers have done just that, closing or altering their business operations while pledging paid leave and embracing telecommuting.Others are giving the bare legal minimum required by law, following inconsistent rules on granting paid leave, or keeping operations running despite shelter-in-place mandates, or refusing to let employees work remotely.A lot of “good guy”/”bad guy” narratives are emerging, and the ratio of concern for people over profits will largely determine which side of the public-perception-divide those employers end up on.AdvertisementOf course, your employer may have reasons for being conservative in granting remote work. Maybe a crucial portion of its services must be performed on site to keep up with increased demand. But that’s all the more reason to allow everyone who can to work remotely — to keep the workplace as safe as possible for those who have to be there.Read more:Working from home: Telecommuting parents, tell us how you are juggling kid responsibilities and paid work."

Michelle Singletary offers tips on meeting urgent financial needs  Our state’s governor recently issued a stay-at-home order and has restricted operation of nonessential businesses. My friend’s job requires him to enter homes, some belonging to hoarders, and clear out trash and junk. He is concerned about potentially being exposed to covid-19 or carrying it to his family. Story continues below  The business is not essential under the governor’s order, but the owner said he would allow his workers to “volunteer” to continue working. Those who refuse are not being paid. What’s more, because they are not being furloughed or let go, they can’t apply for unemployment relief. Tips for employers: What is an “essential business”?Karla: Earn a living, or protect you and yours? It’s not as simple as finding another job; unless you can do remote work, most current hiring is happening in delivery and health care, where risk of exposure to the virus is high.  And with record numbers of people newly out of work, competition is stiffer than ever.AdvertisementFortunately, some new federal laws enacted in response to the pandemic may help make those choices easier for employees and employers.Story continues below  The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires businesses with fewer than 500 employees to provide paid sick leave and paid family leave to workers affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic, such as parents of kids whose school or care options are unavailable. But there are loopholes; an employer with fewer than 50 employees might not have to grant paid leave if it can show that its business would be jeopardized by doing so.The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act has “supercharged” unemployment benefits, according to Declan Leonard, business law partner with Berenzweig Leonard. The CARES Act adds $600 to weekly unemployment checks and expands unemployment to cover more workers. It also includes tax benefits and other support to make layoffs a more palatable option for employers.Some states are adjusting unemployment requirements in response to the pandemic as well; call your state’s employment agency or visit its website for more information and to apply.And if you’re not being paid, or even if your employer refuses to officially lay off or furlough you, Leonard recommends that you still try to apply for benefits. “Where filing for unemployment has historically been a last resort, I now think it should be a first resort for employers and employees alike,” he says.Finally, employers that want to stay open and support employees might consider a small-business loan under the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program. If used for qualified purposes, such as covering payroll and benefits, the loan may be converted to a grant and forgiven. For that reason, Leonard encourages employers to take advantage of the loan program now so they’re ready to resume operations once the current crisis has eased: “The government’s coming in here to give you a lifeline so you can live to fight another day,"" he said.Read more:Older retail workers say they’re worried about their health, but need money Stimulus bill offers relief for retirees"
31,"April 9, 2020","Reader: I have been furloughed down to a two-day workweek due to the impact of the coronavirus on the small business I work for. HR has informed me that I should absolutely not be doing any work for the company on my days off. My boss is expecting the same output for a two-day week as a five-day week; he’s sending me daily emails with tasks that would be nearly impossible to complete in the time I have. What is a diplomatic (and firm) way to set realistic expectations with him? WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Start with a phone call to confirm his intent, in which you open by gently reiterating the constraints on your capacity: “HR told me I’m not allowed to go beyond X hours. It’s not possible for me to finish all these items in that time.” From there, I see two possibilities requiring different approaches:Scenario 1: He’ll indicate he’s just sending you tasks as he thinks of them, knowing they won’t all get done. In this case, you could respond, “Of course I’ll finish as much as I can, but can you help me prioritize so I can focus on your most important items first?”   If you can be flexible about which hours you work, maybe offer a “break glass” option so you can complete urgent tasks right away — but be sure to track that time and include it in your official work hours for that week.Scenario 2: He’ll make clear he expects you to get everything done even if it means working unpaid hours. In that case, you’ll need to punt: “Can we set up a call with HR and see if they’ll consider letting me have more hours?” That phrasing makes clear you’re willing to do the work for him, but your hands are tied. Either HR can warn him that he’s putting the company at risk of violating wage and hour laws, or he can persuade them that you’re doing essential work that requires more paid hours. If he refuses to talk to HR, talk to them yourself so his actions are on the record. If he keeps pushing, neutrally remind him every time that his request will put you beyond your time limit — and document everything.Depending on what state you work in and how much of a pay cut you’ve taken, you may want to consider applying for unemployment benefits from your state. Even though you’re not unemployed, your reduced work and pay could qualify you for partial benefits. And if you qualify for state benefits, you may also qualify for additional money under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) Act. The Cares Act expands the definition of who’s eligible for unemployment benefits and will kick in an additional $600 per week for benefits recipients, at no additional cost to employers, in states that sign on to the federal plan.FAQ: What to do if you get laid off or furloughedBe warned that unemployment agencies nationwide are slammed, states’ eligibility criteria keep changing, and the federal government only recently issued guidance on implementing the Cares Act, so “everyone is trying to make sense of everything” and response times are delayed, says Edgar Ndjatou, executive director of employee advocacy group Workplace Fairness. Still, it’s worth applying now to reserve your place in the queue.Underfunded, understaffed and under siege: Unemployment offices nationwide are strugglingNdjatou recommends filing online when possible, rather than trying to get through jammed phone lines;  compiling thorough records of your work history, hours and income; and keeping copies of everything you file.   He also urges workers to “stay informed and understand what their rights are.” Workplacefairness.org provides a helpful, plain-English summary of each state’s unemployment insurance policies amid the coronavirus crisis, with links.Pro tip: If you’re working a reduced schedule, set up your email auto-response and voice mail to outline your availability and anticipated response time — and stick to them."

It’s an “email collective for an uplifting exchange” in which participants submit a personally inspiring poem, quote, verse or meditation. After selecting their inspirational statement, the participants are asked to email it to themselves and blind-copy 20 other female colleagues they admire. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIf this sounds off to you, it’s probably because you recognize it as a common chain email that has been making the rounds online for years. On your personal email or Facebook, you’d probably just delete or ignore it. But if you received it in your work email inbox from a work colleague, with your employer’s name featured throughout, and read it with your brain in work mode, it might take you a few minutes to catch on.I’ve heard from a number of women who have received this email from co-workers and professional network contacts multiple times in recent weeks. Most just deleted it, some describing the experience as annoying and “a colossal waste of time.” No one has told me she has found it “uplifting.”   Anyone who’s worked with me knows I’m not one to get my lace hankie in a twist over a little subversive fun at work. What’s the big deal about an innocuous attempt to spread a little positivity among colleagues during an anxious, uncertain time? After all, we’re now opening meetings with “How is everyone holding up?” and closing emails with “Stay safe.” Employers everywhere are emphasizing concern for their people, in marketing copy if not in practice. Embracing the human element in our workplaces (figuratively) may be one of the few good things to come from this crisis.But here’s why chain email, no matter how well-intentioned, is not the way to do it:· It’s intrusive. When working from home, it’s hard enough avoiding distractions that siphon away our focus and energy without having to filter out time-wasters disguised as work matters.   · It’s ineffective. When we’re struggling at work, we don’t need scattershot, prêt-à-porter platitudes. We need specific advice, encouragement or offers of help from people who know our situation, strengths and needs.· It may offend. One person’s inspiration is another’s irritation. Some people draw comfort from psalms and hymns; others’ love language is dirty limericks and Lizzo lyrics. Either group bombarding the other with their own particular form of “inspiration” is just asking for an HR intervention.Don't feel like 'getting things done'? It's okay not to be productive during a pandemic.· It undermines women. Women are already expected to be caretakers, even at work. Presenting poetry spam as a “women’s leadership” initiative is just adding insult to indoctrination.Story continues below  · It’s a security risk. Although this chain mail is benign, if annoying, some forwarded messages can carry malicious payloads. Social engineering spam and memes can lure people into revealing personal information. Scams like these have always been around, but they tend to proliferate during a crisis when people are most vulnerable. The coronavirus pandemic has been no exception.Advertisement· It’s deceptive. We’re bombarded daily by confusing, contradictory and even outright false information about coronavirus transmission, treatment and statistics via social media and even by public figures purporting to be reliable authorities. Do we also have to be on guard against misleading missives from our own colleagues?This is not a call to eliminate all forms of compassion, sympathy and support at work. It’s just a recommendation to maintain respectful professional boundaries so we can curb the growth of invasive messages that seek to replicate and distribute their contents to multiple unwitting targets.

33,"April 23, 2020","Reader: My wife works for a day-care business that has been closed by order of the state during the coronavirus pandemic. She was collecting unemployment, including the extra $600 a week provided by the federal government under the Cares Act, but then received an email that the day-care had been approved for a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program. She was told to stop claiming unemployment benefits as she would be paid her regular salary.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightNow the employer is making her work online a few hours a week via video and do busywork. Isn’t the PPP paying people NOT to work?Karla: The Paycheck Protection Program, enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (Cares Act), offers an eight-week loan to small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic — for example, businesses like your wife’s day-care that have been deemed nonessential and ordered to close. The goal of the program, according to Declan Leonard, business law partner at Berenzweig Leonard, “is to keep employees on the company payroll so they don’t go onto the already swollen unemployment rolls” and also so it will be “easier to ramp up operations when the business can fully open back up.”Coronavirus unemployment guide: What to do if you get laid off or furloughedLeonard adds that “the company can still choose to use PPP funds to pay that employee, even if the employee is not actually performing real work.'' But that doesn’t mean the loan is designed to pay people “not to work.” If the employer has tasks that need doing, even if they seem pointless, it can certainly require employees to do them if it’s paying them for their time.   But even if no real work is getting done, Leonard points out that there’s another incentive for businesses to keep workers on the payroll instead of firing or laying them off: PPP loans can be converted to grants and be forgiven if employers (1) use the funds for appropriate purposes (payroll, business mortgage/rent/utilities) and (2) maintain employee and compensation levels for the eight weeks of the loan term. “So an employer who forces an employee onto the unemployment rolls … is jeopardizing the ability to get its PPP loan forgiven,” Leonard notes.All things considered, from the worker’s perspective, I’d take the steady paycheck and the mindless busywork performed in the safety of my home over temporary unemployment benefits (as of now, the $600 Cares Act boost lasts only through July). Of course, if your wife’s regular rate of pay makes wading through the unemployment benefits process look like a better deal, I think that calls for us to reexamine how severely and systemically our nation undervalues the work of child-care providers.Reader: I have been furloughed by my employer, who is still paying us 20 percent of our salary to cover health-care benefits. Do I need to report these as wages on my unemployment claim? I am 100 percent not working during the furlough period, so these wages are not technically from working.   Karla: You may not feel that you “earned” those wages, but they’re still income, and your employer is going to report that it paid you that income, so you should absolutely report them as such when you file for unemployment benefits. Edgar Ndjatou, executive director at worker advocacy group Workplace Fairness, warned me that when applicants underreport income, it’s just a matter of time before the unemployment office finds out. When that happens, you’ll end up having to pay back what you received and getting hit with penalties — or worse.Read more:Your money and the pandemic: We answer your most pressing questions about personal finance"
34,"April 29, 2020","The push to reopen the economy is accelerating. After seven weeks of social distancing and working from home, many Americans are heading back to work — and many employees and consumers are anxious about their safety.Some states are pushing to reopen. Some companies are calling employees back to work after receiving loans to cover losses related to the coronavirus pandemic. Under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was enacted in the Cares Act and given additional funding last week, those business loans can be forgiven entirely if companies do not lay off employees or if they rehire or replace employees that they have already laid off. At least 75 percent of the loan has to be spent on payroll for the loan to be forgiven.Story continues below  Here are some common concerns as Americans head back to work.How to get a small business loan under the new coronavirus $484 billion loan programPlease note none of this is legal advice, and your outcome may vary depending on your situation. You may need to consult legal counsel.Q: Do I have to return to work if I am pregnant or have a health condition that places me at higher risk if I am exposed to the coronavirus?Try to obtain documentation from a health-care provider that you are especially vulnerable and at high risk, and that your health-care provider recommends self-quarantine. Once you have done that, your options include:Advertisement— asking your employer to grant you reasonable accommodations (such as alternative duties or temporary job-protected leave, for example) under the Americans With Disabilities Act.Story continues below  — asking to be granted paid sick or emergency Family and Medical Leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.Q: Can my employer make me return to work if I don’t have child care?Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, employers have to provide employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they can’t work because they have symptoms of covid-19, are quarantined or have to care for a child when schools and day-care centers are closed.Families First requires employers of 500 or fewer to provide partially paid emergency Family and Medical Leave to employees who have children at home needing care.   This option is available only to workers who cannot perform any part of their job at home.If Families First leave is not available — for example, if your employer is so small the Labor Department exempts it — you can try requesting job-protected unpaid leave.Coronavirus unemployment guide: What to do if you get laid off or furloughed?Q: I am not convinced my workplace is safe, and I don’t want to risk exposing myself or people at home. What are my options?If you don’t fall under the Americans With Disabilities Act of Families First options above, your only other option may be to hope to be laid off or furloughed without pay so you can collect unemployment. But an employer who has obtained a PPP loan may not want to take this route.Story continues below  If you’re employed and furloughed, your employer will need to pay you with PPP funds to have its loan forgiven. If you have been laid off, your employer will have to replace you with another hire to keep its head count consistent so it can have the loan forgiven.AdvertisementIf you believe your employer is operating unsafely (refusing to adopt preventive measures or provide sanitizer or PPE, for example), you can file a complaint with your state’s labor agency or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but don’t expect a swift resolution.Q: Do I have to return to work if our state is under stay-at-home orders and our business is nonessential?Your state will have its own rules on how nonessential businesses can operate during the pandemic. These may include limiting the number of workers allowed in the workplace, shuttering its doors to the public or providing workers with protective equipment. If you think your employer is violating the state’s mandates, you can file a complaint with the appropriate state agency.Q: How can I find out if my employer has applied for or received a PPP loan? In most cases, employers will notify their workers if they receive PPP funds because they will need to call them back to work so they can have the loan forgiven. Also, the employer will probably want to adjust its filings with the state’s unemployment office if it starts paying wages to any of its furloughed employees so those workers don’t receive additional unemployment benefits they’re not entitled to.   Publicly traded companies that apply for PPP loans have to file a Form 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That information is searchable on the SEC website.In rare cases, employees can demand information from their employers under disclosure laws. This is a contentious option and should be considered only as a last resort; consult a lawyer before taking this step.Q: Do I have to return to work if I am receiving more in unemployment benefits than I would be receiving in wages?If you qualify for state unemployment benefits because of covid-19, you probably also qualify for an additional $600 per week under the Cares Act. If that’s more money than you receive in regular wages, staying on unemployment may seem like a no-brainer. However, there are risks:Story continues below  If you are invited back to work and turn it down, you may no longer qualify for unemployment benefits under your state’s rules.If your employer decides to lay you off and hire someone else with its PPP funds, you may no longer qualify for unemployment benefits.Even if you stay on unemployment, and your employer simply hires someone else without challenging your rights to unemployment benefits, the Cares Act’s $600-per-week benefits boost will end by July 31, 2020.After that, if you can’t get by on state unemployment benefits, you’ll need to find another job — and so will millions of other people.Q: My employer got a PPP loan and is asking us to do work other than what we usually do — cleaning the office for example — until the business reopens. Do I have to do this?Employers don’t have to require employees to do work when it’s paying them with PPP funds — but as discussed last week, if there’s work to be done, the employer can require it, even if it’s not the same work you usually perform. If the work exposes you to health risks, you may be able to seek a reasonable accommodation under Americans with Disabilities or file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But if you refuse to do the work, your employer may be able to fire you for cause, which could jeopardize your eligibility for unemployment benefits.Q: My employer is giving hourly workers only six hours a day. Can they do this?Under the Cares Act, employers have to spend at least 75 percent of the PPP loan on payroll costs to have the loan forgiven. Employees must receive 75 percent of the average weekly pay they received for the first quarter of 2020. If they’re working six hours instead of eight, that’s 75 percent, which is enough for the employer’s PPP loan to be forgiven.   If the pay you’re receiving is less than 75 percent, you may qualify for partial benefits with your state’s unemployment agency.Q: Do employers have to rehire the same people to have the PPP loan forgiven, or can they hire someone new?The goal of the PPP is to allow employers to retain their workforce and minimize the costs of hiring and training new talent, while reducing the burden on state unemployment systems. But companies do not have to hire back the same workers as long as their overall employment numbers remain the same.Q: My employer has two businesses but got a PPP loan for just one of them, which is not the one I work for, so I am working unpaid. Can my boss do this? Employers applying for PPP loans must disclose any affiliated companies. It all depends on the details of how your employer’s businesses are structured, but generally, if the employer applied for a PPP loan for one business, using information from the other, the PPP loan funds should be used to pay employees of both companies.   Regardless, if you are doing any work unpaid, that is wage theft. You should report it to your state’s labor agency and the federal Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division.Q: Where can I complain if I believe my employer is abusing its PPP loan?You can report suspected PPP fraud anonymously to the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General at 1-800-767-0385 or at sba.gov. Just know that, as with most employment-related public agencies right now, the SBA is slammed and underfunded, so any complaints may take a long time to be resolved.Many thanks to Amy Epstein Gluck and Lenore Horton, partners at FisherBroyles LLP; Declan Leonard, business law partner at Berenzweig Leonard; and Tom Spiggle, principal at Spiggle Law.Helpful resources:U.S. Department of Labor Coronavirus page Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Q&A on ADA and other anti-discrimination laws regarding coronavirus Your state may have even more relevant information about unemployment rules.

When a co-worker recently scheduled a two-hour meeting at 4:30 p.m. with one day's notice, I asked if I could present my topic early in the meeting so I could make my class. She refused, calling it a “conflict of interest.” Is there an acceptable way to refuse invites for these meetings outside normal business hours? Or is this the new Monday — Friday? And is teaching a fitness class after work really a “conflict of interest?”    Karla: For anyone lucky enough to be working from home, the concept of “normal business hours” — more accurately, “pre-pandemic business hours” — has been upended. Before I get into how you deal with that, some reasons it’s happening:Parents whose card-house schedules have been flattened and scattered to the winds are having to shuffle work hours with managing their kids’ education and care.Carolyn Hax Live: Why do working parents get a free pass during Covid-19?Employees living in isolation may be struggling to keep themselves on task without the guide rails of a busy workplace — or may be actively seeking more work to occupy themselves.People whose “golden hours” of productivity naturally skew earlier or later than the typical business day may find it less exhausting to stop fighting their internal clock.Regardless of family status, most of us are experiencing some mix of wakeful anxiety, crushing depression and numbing fear that demolishes the nine-to-five mind-set.We’re not robots. We can’t perform as normal during not-normal times. But unlike robots, we can adapt, and working remotely gives us the flexibility to adapt so we can stay as balanced and productive as possible. The problem arises when one person’s option to be flexible begets an expectation that everyone else will bend in the same direction, at the same time, to the same degree.Work Advice: Getting things done right in a ‘get it done now’ cultureBosses are allowed those expectations. But good bosses try to base their expectations on broad principles and priorities, accommodate individuals’ challenges in meeting those expectations, and grant employees autonomy to set reasonable boundaries for themselves within those expectations.   All of which is to say, start by checking whether your “normal business hours” need to be adjusted to fit mid-pandemic reality. Talk to your boss about establishing core hours of availability within flexible shifts (for example, core hours 10 to 2 daily, with early starts on specific days and late ends on others).Once you have your boss’s support, and you have communicated your availability clearly via your online calendar/auto-reply/voice mail greeting, here are some tips on defending your schedule so you’re not having to cover every time zone.When someone schedules a meeting last-minute with seemingly no regard for the invitees’ availability, that creates a “conflict,” full stop — regardless whether you’re using that time to teach Zumba, talk to your therapist on Zoom or just zone out. And that’s all you need to say, although you can soften your RSVP by offering an alternative:   “I’m sorry, I have a conflict that day. Can we try later in the week?”“I can attend the first part of the meeting, but I have a hard stop at 6.”“I’m not available Tuesdays after 5, but any other evening will work for me.”Yes, aligning with other people’s frayed edges takes extra effort. But we will get through this with less damage if we all extend some grace and accept some misalignments as part of the new design."

It sounds to me as though your boss is trying to work with you, so I would treat unemployment as a last resort after you’ve exhausted all attempts to negotiate a solution that covers each of your basic needs.   For example, can you come in for the most intense hours of the day and use vacation leave for the rest? Can you swap some duties with other workers? Can you have work calls forwarded or check voice mail from your personal phone? Can your poor kid — pinned at that age between needs and responsibilities — agree to do her “job” for just a few hours while you’re doing yours, after which your time and attention are all hers?And while I know too viscerally the agony of postponing already-too-seldom visits with distant loved ones, you should rethink how you plan to use vacation leave this year.

I was surprised by how much we all enjoyed it.”AdvertisementSo much for my skepticism; you had me at “deep-dish Chicago pizza.” Check back in December and find out if online pizza parties manage to supplant the much-maligned year-end holiday office party.Technical update: Last week, businesses that received Paycheck Protection Program loans finally received a bit more guidance on how to qualify to have those loans forgiven. The Small Business Administration’s loan forgiveness application form instructions clarify how and when the eight-week clock starts running on a PPP loan and how to determine employee head count to ensure the employer meets criteria for loan forgiveness.Although employers generally have to maintain the same number of employees to have their PPP loan converted to a grant, the new form outlines one noteworthy exception: An employer does not have to hire replacements for employees who (1) rejected a good-faith written offer by the employer to rehire them, (2) were fired for cause, or (3) voluntarily resigned or asked for reduced hours."
38,"May 28, 2020","  I recently retired from the company where I had been for six years. Since the pandemic, everyone had been working from home. Even though my retirement was announced to our larger division, I received no notes from outside my very small department. My boss mailed me a card with a $25 gift certificate to a store I don’t shop at. (I’m sure the money came out of her pocket.) I feel miffed that there was no other recognition. When I left previous jobs at two other companies, I received cards, cash, parties, cakes, etc.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: I’m going to lead with kindness here: “Miffed” is a reaction best saved for deliberate or brutally inconsiderate snubs. I suspect you’re feeling more hurt, disappointed, even a little fist-to-sky angry at being denied acknowledgment of a once-in-a-lifetime transition. Other retirees, newlyweds and graduates of all ages can no doubt identify with this.But as of this writing, about 100,000 people have lost their lives and close to 40 million have lost their jobs. Even if your business has been relatively untouched by the coronavirus pandemic, your colleagues are no doubt focused on maintaining life and livelihood. Anything that doesn’t support those efforts is collateral damage.   Given the circumstances, I recommend you count yourself lucky if a proper send-off is the greatest loss you suffer this year, and host your own celebration once the danger has passed.  My company just underwent a massive layoff because of covid-19. I am very fortunate to still have my job but sad to be losing many colleagues, some of whom I have worked with for many years. What are appropriate ways to acknowledge these colleagues? Karla: Throwing them a lifeline is the first thing that comes to mind. Offer to serve as a reference for anyone who needs it. Keep your eyes and ears open for opportunities that might fit someone you know. Forward résumés along if you have connections. Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) is great for this, especially if you want to pool resources with other still-employed colleagues. And if you’re in a position to convince your employer to file unemployment claims with the state on behalf of those laid off, that could save a lot of headaches.   The next best thing is to let your former colleagues know they haven’t been forgotten. Even if you don’t have a job lead to offer, a simple check-in by email, phone or text can make a difference.One caveat: You don’t want to stoke resentment or give your employer cause to suspect you of doing so. When you reach out to former colleagues, try to keep the focus on their well-being and their future, and avoid workplace gossip. Work Advice: Preparing for layoffs and related hazardsReader 3: If I am offered a job by a different company while on furlough, do I still have to give a two-week notice?Karla: Oh my sweet summer child, no. Unless it’s something you committed to in a contract, two weeks’ notice is courtesy, not law. The idea behind giving notice is to allow you time to wrap up or delegate any outstanding projects, and to give the employer time to start finding a replacement for you. But if you’ve been on furlough, that’s probably not a concern.Work Advice: I was passed over for promotion. Is it disloyal to look elsewhere?This also is not a law, but it’s smart: Before you breathe a word to your current employer, make sure the new job offer is solid and legitimate. This is not the time to let go of one vine before you’ve firmly grasped the next."
39,"June 4, 2020","This week feels like a good opportunity to pause and meditate on loss.Last week I responded to a disappointed reader whose retirement was largely overlooked by colleagues who were presumably distracted by trying to function during a pandemic.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIt’s true, that reader’s loss was minor in comparison to what many are experiencing. But it’s also about something deeper than a forgone cake or plaque. The celebration of retirement places a capstone on a lifetime of effort, connections and service, a monument to show that it all mattered. Without that monument, the builder feels forgotten, lost to history.For some workers, the coronavirus pandemic has preempted their entire end-of-credits sail into the sunset. With furloughs and layoffs cutting wide swaths through the workforce, an uncertain recovery timeline and a job market already saturated with age bias, many workers near the end of their careers have essentially been made involuntary retirees. As with newlyweds and graduates, their major life event — for many, the last milestone of their careers — has been swamped by a rising tide of grief, fear and unrest.   The following letter, reproduced with minimal editing, is a poignant account of one such abrupt ending:""I scrolled your article Sunday at 5:25 a.m., my standard wake-up time since 1999 when I returned to the workforce after a seven-year hiatus to raise my young daughters. Minus those seven years, I’ve held a job every year of my life since I was 12. I’m 63. I like to work. I always have. I like the ritual. The smell of the coffee brewing, the familiar sounds of my “Morning Joe” friends, calibrating the time it takes to put my makeup on, pour the second cup of coffee, start the car for the four-minute drive to the Goldens Bridge train station to catch the 6:57 into Manhattan. But mostly, I like to work. I held a unique position in HR in learning and development for a young, successful cosmetics company. I spent most days onboarding new hires, product training, coaching young leaders, mentoring or hosting office events. Bringing people together was my ‘thing’ and often came with a hug.On Friday, March 13, the New York metro area shut down with shelter-in-place orders from Gov. Andrew Cuomo in response to the coronavirus pandemic. On April 16 I was furloughed. On May 26 I got my first unemployment check.   I had not planned on retiring. I loved my work. Retail has taken a devastating blow, and furloughs impacted all departments. I am realistic and doubtful I’ll be called back. If they call, I’ll be there.I still wake up at 5:25 a.m. Brew the coffee. Watch “Morning Joe.” No makeup. I hear the 6:57 train whistle in the distance and think of the sweet-faced conductor who always met my gaze. How are all of my fellow commuters on the platform doing? How are my friends and colleagues coping? Do they know how much I miss them? My work wasn’t finished. We didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.My new ritual includes a 9 a.m. three-mile walk and consuming news. I cry daily for the lives lost and for all those families and loved ones that didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.""— Laura Filancia, Goldens Bridge, N.Y.My continued sympathy to all who are suffering losses, great and small, personal and professional.

Many found their hours were cut, their pay was reduced, and their job descriptions had changed — sometimes beyond all recognition.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightReader: I am a restaurant worker on unemployment because of covid-19. Our employer has received a Paycheck Protection Program loan and is offering to hire 15 to 20 of us back as maintenance workers. We are all servers, bartenders and hosts. None of us has ever performed any maintenance work. What you need to know about going back to workThe job requirements for the maintenance position are outrageous. We must be able to lift 100 pounds or more. (Some of our hostesses barely weigh more than that.) Also, the position requires extensive relevant experience, or training and skills such as replacing and repairing electrical and plumbing fixtures, operating power tools and cleaning equipment, and performing major janitorial duties. They have given us only one or two days to respond to this offer.   We believe they’re hoping we’ll decline the offer. We’ve been told our company has been trying to “clean house” for months, and management has changed multiple times in the past few years. We believe they are taking advantage of this pandemic to get rid of us. Can we take any legal action?Karla: This goes beyond bartenders delivering food to homes and bouncers scrubbing toilets. It sounds like they’re making you an offer they know you’ll refuse. But is it unlawful?For purposes of PPP loan forgiveness, under updated guidance, employers are not required to replace workers who reject a good-faith written job offer. Paul Abraham, managing attorney at business law firm PJI Law, notes that the PPP guidance requires only that “the offer be for the ‘same salary or wages’ and ‘same number of hours’ ” as the worker was receiving before the shutdown.   Still, even if you’re being offered a different position because your old skills aren’t needed right now, “the offer does have to be made in ‘good faith,’ ” notes Abraham. “Does a restaurant really need 15 janitors and no servers?”If you have an employment contract, employers can’t change the terms of that contract without consent, says Edgar Ndjatou, executive director of Workplace Fairness. In any case, Ndjatou thinks it’s worth asking management to clarify what they expect and whether these positions really are the only options available for returning to work.If so, you might bring this situation to the attention of the Small Business Administration, which administers the PPP loans, and the Department of Labor. And don’t forget strength in numbers: The more people who add their voices to the complaint, the better the odds it will be heard.Stay safe and informed as the United States reopens with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletterReader: Since the pandemic started, the owner of our company decided to change all employees from salaried to hourly to avoid layoffs or furloughs. Now that we are hourly workers, the owner says we are no longer eligible for paid vacation time. I am curious about my rights.   Karla: The employment lawyers I consulted confirmed that they’re seeing more employers changing employees’ status under the Fair Labor Standards Act from exempt (salaried) to nonexempt (paid hourly, eligible for overtime) to manage costs during the pandemic when there isn’t enough work to fill a 40-hour week.The catch is that when business picks up again, anyone working more than 40 hours in a week will be entitled to overtime pay. Reclassifying you as exempt isn’t just a matter of checking a different box. It means re-examining such factors as the type of work you perform, how much you earn weekly, and how much independent judgment you exercise to make sure you actually qualify as exempt, says Amy Epstein Gluck, partner at FisherBroyles.Generally, offering paid or unpaid vacation leave is up to your employer, regardless of your FLSA status. But if your employer is trying to cancel paid leave you’ve already accrued, that may not be allowed depending on what state you work in. Epstein Gluck notes that some states require employers to pay out unused PTO to their employees.

He publicly shoots down our team’s ideas in a dismissive and antagonistic way, then complains that no one is taking any initiative.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI don’t think I can talk to him about it. I think he is overwhelmed by stress but would not react well to any suggestion that he’s not himself.I talk with my therapist about how this affects me and how I can take care of myself. But I’m increasingly resentful of his behavior and unwilling to let it go without saying something in those moments when my team and I are being treated like idiots or slackers.Karla: If the pandemic were a board game, we would all at some point have landed on a square marked “blow your stack, lose one turn.” Still, anxiety is not an excuse to drag everyone else into your vortex. Bosses in particular have a responsibility to demonstrate calm, even-keeled leadership and be open to feedback about requests that seem erratic or inconsistent.   “Being comfortable talking about your emotional life is so important now” for healthy communication in the workplace, says Claire Odom, a clinical social worker with the inclusiveness-promoting program Workplace Initiative. Although most everyone is anxious and stressed now, she says, “people don’t know that they’re anxious.”Work Advice: Is this angry boss a jerk, or could he have Alzheimer's?So confronting your boss with a diagnosis is not likely to lead to a good outcome. A Boss Whisperer who has his ear could simply ask, “Is everything okay?” But if he’s not the kind to admit when he’s acting under the influence of human emotions, that may not get you anywhere either.I recommend an all-business approach. Meet with your boss in private to focus on a work issue that needs solving — but use common therapy tools designed to defuse defensiveness: validating, mirroring, drawing him out.   “I’ve been thinking about what you said about taking more initiative. Can we review these options for solving [the work issue]?” Then, if (when) he shoots them all down: “I’m hearing these ideas don’t work for you. If we had to pick one, what would you prefer? Or is there something else I’m not thinking of?”If he goes into puffer fish mode: “Maybe this isn’t a good time. What would be a better time to talk about this?” If you are able to reach a consensus, send a follow-up email afterward summarizing what you and he agreed to.You’ve probably already addressed this in therapy, but keep tabs on your own state of mind when responding to your boss so you can maintain a neutral tone.

To protect his privacy, I don’t want to explain that his performance is also a factor, and hinting obscurely about “other reasons” would incite gossip. I don’t want him to feel that we misled him when we first discussed his termination, and don’t want him to get resentful and “poison” the rest of the staff.AdvertisementKarla: But you did mislead him. You fed him an “it’s not you, it’s us” line when it’s actually at least a little bit of “him.” Granted, there’s no good way to say, “Your performance just didn’t inspire us to fight to keep you around” — and there’s no value in saying it this late in the game.Story continues below  Giving advance notice can be a kindness, or it can backfire. A disgruntled employee will produce progressively lower-quality work, damage office morale and possibly goad you into blurting a hurtful truth.Even though it’s inconvenient and costly, the quickest and most face-saving option would be to send him off now with a severance package equal to what he would have earned for the rest of the summer.

42,"June 25, 2020","Like most advice columns, this one keeps reader questions anonymous. Not just to protect the employers and employees concerned, but also because most issues that come up could happen anywhere, to anyone.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightBut it’s not hard to connect the dots between my June 11 column on a restaurant offering to hire back service staff as maintenance workers — now required to lift 100 pounds or more —  and a June 19 Los Angeles Times article by food columnist Lucas Kwan Peterson with almost identical details. According to the L.A. Times, Yamashiro, a well-known establishment on the Hollywood dining scene, obtained a Paycheck Protection Program loan to help meet payroll and other expenses during the coronavirus pandemic shutdown. The restaurant contacted former servers, bartenders and other front-of-house staff with an offer to hire them back — but into maintenance positions completely different from the jobs they had previously held.The reader who submitted the question for my column, former Yamashiro server Alexander Galvez (identified here with permission), said he and his colleagues thought the restaurant was trying to “clean house” and intended for them to decline the offer. Under the PPP rules, those loans will still qualify for forgiveness if workers turn down a good-faith written offer to rehire. Work Advice: Team building and the coronavirus pandemicI spoke with representatives of the restaurant, and they said the entire situation was misconstrued.   “We had made offers to existing staff to come back to the facility to assist with the individual things that needed to be done to position the facility for reopening,” said Tim McCouch of public relations firm TLK Fusion.“Everyone got the same offer,” said Freddy Braidy, CEO of BNG, one of the firms operating Yamashiro since 2016. According to Braidy, a “handful” of former employees came back to help reorganize and upgrade the restaurant.But what about the job offer requirement that “the employee must regularly lift and/or move more than 100 pounds” and perform essential duties such as “replacing … outlets, garbage disposals, faucets and toilet parts” and “installing light fixtures”? Story continues below  McCouch replied that California requires a high level of disclosure and transparency in job descriptions so employees fully understand everything the job may entail. According to Braidy, the restaurant “never asked anyone that wasn’t qualified to do a trade to do those activities,” instead hiring outside professionals for specialty electrical and plumbing work.Advertisement“This was, ‘pick up a paintbrush, move a few chairs around … and let’s get some money back in your pocket,’ ” said Ken Collis, also with TLK Fusion.However, state labor authorities seem to agree that employees who declined Yamashiro’s offer were justified in doing so. Loree Levy, a spokeswoman for California’s Employment Development Department (EDD), confirmed that, generally speaking, “where the work that is offered is not in the individual’s usual occupation, and is not appropriate based on the individual’s prior training and experience, the position offered would not likely be suitable.”Story continues below  In other words, a worker who turned down such an offer could still receive California unemployment benefits.Galvez said he and others who turned down the rehire offer with Yamashiro successfully demonstrated to the EDD that the job offer was unsuitable by providing copies of their communications with management, after which they began receiving unemployment benefits. AdvertisementAccording to Galvez, former employees were given until June 4 to accept or decline the maintenance job offer. The next day, he said, their old front-of-house jobs were advertised online. Yamashiro maintains that the ad was part of ongoing efforts to attract and retain talent and they had simply failed to cancel the ad during the shutdown.Story continues below  “While we were employing and serving food, that ad was running, and that ad will continue to run,” said McCouch. (Note: As of June 23, no jobs were listed as available at Yamashiro on LinkedIn or Glassdoor; Indeed.com showed one ad for “FOH team member” candidates at Yamashiro with bartending, running, serving and bussing experience. According to the date stamp, it was posted June 4.) Work Advice: What you need to know about going back to workAt any rate, the restaurant was due to reopen Thursday, and those employees who came back to work will put down their paintbrushes and go back to mixing drinks and running orders. AdvertisementYamashiro did not respond directly to questions about whether it would restore the original pre-pandemic job titles and descriptions for the rehired employees.Story continues below  And Galvez, now working at a West Hollywood bar, says he and some former colleagues have obtained legal representation with the intent to take legal action against Yamashiro.I later heard from other former employees of Yamashiro who confirmed that they had seen brief or no interruption in their unemployment benefits after turning down the job offer. Several also confirmed that they were taking or were considering joining in legal action against the restaurant for different causes.“As of right now there are no lawsuits,"" Braidy said. ""We did everything by the book and as advised by our HR department.”"

I got a technical job and was so good at it that I was promoted to management. I supervised a team of other technical people, and I was also very good at that. Because I had taught myself social skills, I could both relate to them and help them improve their own social skills, using what I had taught myself.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThen I was moved into a second management job, where I supervise a wider group of people. Those employees have complained because they want me to be more “normal,” which I think means to better fit their expectations for a buddy boss. Would it be productive to explain why I am how I am? Could that lead to a useful discussion of accepting neurodiversity, or is the stigma against autism so great that doing so would torpedo my career?   Karla: Just thinking of the sheer number of people in my personal circle who are, or are related to, people with diagnosed sensory and processing differences, I can’t help hoping that most people’s understanding of autism has graduated beyond movie stereotypes and sitcom punchlines. Even so, many neurodiverse children and adults are vulnerable to misunderstanding, judgment, abuse and worse by those in authority — in education, in the workplace and in the justice system.A young black autistic man was sentenced to 50 years for a car crash. Tens of thousands of people are now calling for his freedom.As a successful professional on the autism spectrum, you have a tremendous opportunity to spread awareness. Of course, being an autism ambassador isn’t and shouldn’t have to be in your job description. Unfortunately, your socialization skills, though hard won and carefully applied, are not quite seamlessly aligned with your new team’s expectations — and that’s what can torpedo your career as a manager.I’m in no position to say whether mentioning autism would spark an “aha” moment for good or ill in your colleagues’ minds. But you don’t need to mention your diagnosis to acknowledge that we all have differences in how we process information and react to invisible cues. Some of us are visual learners; others need spoken instructions. Certain tones or expressions trigger different reactions based on our personal history. A busy environment can sap or stimulate.   For the most part, we unconsciously adjust and compensate for these differences. But consciously addressing those differences as they come up is an excellent way to defuse a misunderstanding. For example, if you know you come across as “checked out” when you’re actually concentrating on forming an answer, explain that you need time to process. (“One moment please, my brain is buffering.”)For that matter, frank talk can also help clarify what your team members need from you. You “think” they want a “buddy boss,” but have you invited them to tell you specifically what they would find helpful — words of validation, expressions of interest in their non-work lives, a diagram of your thought process?Incidentally, under the heading “it’s an ill wind that blows no good,” one convenient launchpad for these discussions is the covid-19 pandemic. Even if it hasn’t visibly changed your workplace, odds are most people are feeling out of sync with their routines and expectations, leading to miscommunication and friction. Engaging others in deliberate conversation about the upheaval they’re going through, how they’re compensating, and the minor adjustments that would help them better cope might foster more general empathy and patience with differing response times, productivity and expectations.Work Advice: In the pandemic workplace, meetings outside office hours are becoming a constantAt any rate, regardless of whether you bring up your autism with your subordinates, one group with whom I think you should be explicit about your autism is HR. Disclosing your diagnosis to HR, even if you don’t need any accommodations, will trigger protections under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which may come in handy if you find yourself targeted by discriminatory behavior or complaints from those who want you to act more like them.Pro tip: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy offers an archive of helpful resources on hiring and managing workers on the autism spectrum, as well as firsthand accounts from workers on finding and navigating work in a neurotypical environment.

44,"July 9, 2020","With everyone scrambling to stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic, businesses and employees are operating under less-than-ideal conditions. (The same can also apply at times of ordinary organizational change at work.)  But there’s a fine line between being a good sport and being played. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight  I was furloughed because of covid-19, with my employer generously continuing to cover my medical benefits. I am going to be called back to work soon with a 25 percent reduction in salary. I do not want to seem ungrateful, but I also do not want to take less money for doing the same job, with a likely increase in responsibilities because the entire team will not be recalled. Do I have any recourse, or am I expecting too much?Karla: It’s understandable that you would feel thankful to have a job when so many others are still unemployed. But remember that even a generous employer’s choice to bring you back onboard involves a business calculation. Paying out 75 percent of a salary in exchange for 125 percent of a job is a pretty sweet deal — for the employer.   Still, your humility is heartwarming, and it will serve you well as you diplomatically press your bosses for information on when they hope to restore balance to this equation. They probably can’t guarantee a date, but they should be willing to identify benchmarks — revenue or profit levels, for example — that would indicate the company is able to return to pre-pandemic payroll levels. At the very least, they should recognize the need for compensatory down time to keep from burning you out. If they refuse to commit to righting this imbalance, you may not be able to walk away now, but you can mentally point your toes toward the door in preparation for any opportunities that pop up. That’s not ingratitude; it’s business sense.Work Advice: My hours have been cut by coronavirus, but my workload hasn't  Shortly before I started as the number-two member on a new team, the number-one person unexpectedly left. Now our new CEO is reorganizing things, dimming prospects that we’ll ever be able to replace the team lead. I’m eager to prove my mettle as an interim team leader. But one of my two bosses has told me to avoid “active participation” in meetings, I assume because it jeopardizes her case for hiring a new leader and having a full team again. Meanwhile, my other boss seems convinced that present circumstances leave no alternative but for me to perform the leader’s duties, and advises that I do so quietly. They are in discussions to resolve the matter, but a stalemate seems inevitable. Your advice?   Karla: If your new CEO is looking to streamline, my first suggestion would be to take a hard look at the apparent redundancy in your middle-management structure. But the CEO’s not asking my advice.Agreeing to take on more work for no credit, authority or increased pay is a sucker’s bet. And taking on more duties in secret at one boss’s urging means undermining the other boss’s goals. Whoever wins,  the person in the middle (which of course is you in this case) is guaranteed to lose.Work Advice: A resolution to set better boundaries at workBut that doesn’t mean you can’t take some initiative; you just have to be transparent about it. Take note of what specific tasks need doing and why, and ask both your bosses if they want you to tackle them. Focus on specific tasks — not “Do you want me to take charge of the XYZ Project?” but “Do you want me to ask the XYZ Project team for a status report on their tasks this week so you can see if we’re on schedule?”   That shows you have a leader’s ability to see what needs attention, but you’re not overstepping or undermining. If you end up doing the work, those small tasks can add up to leadership skills for your résumé. If you’re told to hold off and the project fails, your integrity remains intact.Pro tip: If you can’t get your higher-ups to write down what you’ve agreed to, send them a follow-up email summarizing your understanding of the terms, and keep a copy to refer to later."

In a moment of panic, I quit without giving notice, knowing I was burning a bridge. I was there just shy of one year.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI have always had rave recommendations from employers, but now I cannot give my most recent manager as a reference. I suspect she is mad at me, but I don't know for sure.I can get stellar references from several people at my previous job, where I was for five years. The company I worked at before then is no longer in existence, and I don't know how to get in touch with the owner.White House tells 18 million unemployed workers to 'Find something new' in ad campaignWhat do I do when I am specifically asked for my most recent supervisor as a reference? Is it okay to list colleagues or subordinates? This was my first management job, and some of the jobs I am applying for are leadership roles, so a reference from this most recent job would be relevant.   Karla: Before we get into references, let’s consider which looks more damning on your résumé: a gap in your work history or a job that ends abruptly.Arguments for omitting the job from your résumé altogether: First, it lasted less than a year. Second, even though you were in a management position, the circumstances of your departure don’t paint a picture of reliable leadership. If an interviewer contacts that supervisor for a reference, the best you can hope for is that she’ll just confirm the dates you worked there. You can list former colleagues or the HR department, of course, but failing to list a supervisor when specifically requested suggests (correctly, in this case) that you are dodging.Pandemic stress is bringing out our boss's nasty sideArguments for including the job: It fills the gap, it shows a career path of increasing responsibility, and it would not be untruthful to say that you left the job because of the pandemic. I don’t know what your personal situation was, but presumably you could have powered through at work if covid-induced changes to your workplace and the world in general hadn’t tilted the floor under you. I’m sure you’re not the only employee for whom covid-19 became the final straw on top of the already staggering burden of daily life.   If you decide to include the job, you have some work to do preparing answers for the inevitable questions your work history will raise. Therapy can help you make sense of what you did and what you’ve learned, plus help you develop healthier coping mechanisms for the future. While some toxic situations may justify cutting ties without explanation, “ghosting” in the employment context has become all too common in recent years, on the employer and employee sides of the job market. And as you’re realizing, when employers have the upper hand, you want to keep as many bridges whole as you can.You might even gain the perspective to contact the boss you ghosted just to say, “I’m sorry I left you high and dry. A combination of issues from the pandemic and my personal life left me overwhelmed and unable to cope.

46,"July 23, 2020","Last week, I invited readers to share how coronavirus stress — not the virus itself, but the mental and emotional fallout of living and working through a pandemic — has affected them at work. Even if you’re able to work with minimal exposure to the virus and minimal disruption to your income, general anxiety and the struggle to adapt to a new work environment can wear you down and make it hard to keep up with your job.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRight“I am definitely being contacted by more people seeking guidance on how to cope with increased pressure and those toying with the idea of calling it quits,” says Jim Weinstein, a psychotherapist and career counselor practicing in Washington.To help build resilience and maintain psychological reserves, Weinstein suggests various strategies including exercise; a daily routine that may involve prayer, meditation, learning a new skill, or simple but satisfying chores; eschewing overexposure to news and tuning in to uplifting content; and staying connected with friends and family online.Netflix added 10.1 million subscribers this spring as people around the world stayed homePersonally, as someone prone to “doomscrolling” through media feeds, I second Weinstein’s call for uplifting content. I’m also a believer in scheduling time for “breakdown” content: cathartic books, music, movies or other art that helps you safely bleed off pent-up grief, fear and anger.   And while the urge to feather one’s quarantine nest with useful or comforting possessions is understandable, Weinstein advises clients to “rein in spending and build a financial buffer that will help you cope with unexpected developments,” or that can be used on “additional education, training, and/or certification [that] may be necessary to shifting your career.”Now let’s hear  from readers working in two particularly high-stress situations. Retirement plan down because of covid-19? Here’s why you still need stocks in your 401(k).  I work in the travel industry, in a company going through a takeover. Roughly 70 percent of our staff has either been laid off or given reduced hours. The rest of us have been working with no time off, under more stressful conditions than I have seen in 23 years. We’re all coming to the end of our tethers. Work used to feel like a reprieve from my own brain, but I have been considering quitting every day since April. The theory going around is that if the new management makes things miserable enough, people will quit and save them thousands [of dollars] on severance. The current situation and new management have me questioning whether my mental health is worth the decent severance payment I stand to receive if I stay until I’m laid off.   Karla: I believe you that this is the worst your industry has been in decades. No one could blame you for walking away. But what would you be walking into? Unemployment, an equally bad job in the same field, or a whole new career? Will that preserve your health, or make things worse?It’s precisely because you’ve been around this long that I hope you can find it in you, perhaps drawing on some self-care strategies, to hold out a little longer. Your years of experience give you perspective and stability that your junior colleagues need. And (murmuring behind my hand) you might find some ornery motivation in denying the new management a cheap out.  I work for a nonfederal government entity in public health. In late February, I was asked to “tone down” my scary rhetoric about something that was “never going to hit our state.” By April, I was accused of not being passionate enough about “ending” the pandemic. In May, I was accused of trying to make an official “look bad” because of the facts (written by doctors!) my office was releasing. I regularly receive requests that amount to either making things look good or making the bad things go away by the end of the business day. The officials I work with don’t want to be briefed, and publicly make attractive promises without asking the experts and front-line workers what’s possible.   I’ve worked in government and politics for over 20 years, but never before been in a situation where citizens are literally dying by the day because of those behaviors. I’ve gone way past burnout, and I’m numb for a majority of the time. But I’ve been a public health advocate since long before these officials got elected. I’ll continue to be a public health advocate after this is over, if it ever is. That helps a lot.Karla: Again, no one would blame you for bailing on this thankless job. But along with supplying food and providing health care, battling fantasy with facts is one of the most essential jobs right now. I hope you, too, can find strength and strategies to help you keep at it. Taking the long view is a good start.

47,"July 30, 2020","  Because of the coronavirus pandemic, I’m stuck at an office manager job I was already planning to quit. I had forced myself to stay a full year at my friends’ urging, only to have all hell break loose in 2020. Teleworking has been helpful during this time, because the long daily commute was killing me. But working remotely has exposed the things I dislike most about my job: lack of leadership, unclear lines of responsibility and general disorganization and dysfunction. Since we’ve been teleworking, I’ve been the only one answering our office’s main phone line for four solid months, because it has to be forwarded to someone’s cellphone. I turn 50 soon; I don’t want to be head receptionist anywhere. Also, pandemic or not, this full-time job has always had a part-time workload, which was another reason I wanted to leave. At least now, instead of sitting around my office doing nothing for large portions of the day, I’m hanging around my apartment where I can do laundry, read, watch endless covid-19 news coverage, etc. My original plan was to resign in good standing and return to the service industry for a bit, but then the service industry collapsed. With the high unemployment rate and a desperate need to keep my health insurance, my revised goal is to leave by the end of this year. But I’m battling the urge to just run out the door.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightCoronavirus stress made me ghost my boss. What do I do for a reference?Karla: Keep battling that urge. Even if this job is not your preferred situation, it’s a better option now than joblessness, especially for workers in your age bracket.   I get it: Cultivating patience and gratitude is hard enough when you’ve chosen to stay in a job you don’t care for. When the choice has been taken out of your hands, it’s nearly impossible.And yet, your letter has a whiff of helpless inertia about it. You stayed at the lackluster job because your friends urged you to. The pandemic slammed the exit door in your face and nailed shut the service-industry window for good measure. You’re trapped; you have no other options.Except you do. Even if you’re not the one calling the shots, you may be able to suggest or quietly implement some changes that will make your workday a bit more efficient and tolerable. Maybe you could let reception calls go to voice mail, where you check and respond to them twice a day, instead of spending the entire day on alert in case a call comes in. I can’t be the only one who’s encountered “Due to covid-19” voice mail greetings. As long as I get a response to my message within 24 hours, I’m fine with it. Assuming you’re not, like, a 911 dispatcher, I’m assuming most of your clients would be, too.Back at work but facing a 25 percent pay cutMore options: You have bonus morning and evening time when your commute is no longer sucking the life out of you. Your unfilled work hours no longer have to be spent performing busyness in front of your office mates; you can spend that time doing things that actively benefit you. In sweatpants, even. And to buy yourself even more time, I strongly suggest taking a break from CovidWatch 2020.   How to spend that time? You don’t mention what you’re doing to prepare to leave by the end of the year, but you’ll never have a better opportunity than now to squeeze in a little job research, buff up your résumé, or upgrade your skills out of your employer’s line of sight. If you’re lucky, “by the end of this year” could come sooner than you expect.Of course, your inertia may be due to internal drag rather than external forces. You certainly wouldn’t be the only reader I’ve heard from who suffers from depression presenting as apathy, or anxiety disguised as frustration. You have options for dealing with those, too. If none of the self-care strategies discussed last week in this column can help nudge you a few steps forward, some online sessions with a professional could come in handy."
48,"August 6, 2020","Another reader responds to our recent query about pandemic stress affecting work performance.Reader: I have succeeded at my job by being highly organized; it’s my core professional identity. But recently I seem to have lost my grip on this completely. I discover much later that I didn’t complete tasks; I regard deadlines with a bizarre lack of interest; I look dumbly at empty cells on spreadsheets, slowly grasping that the data from the past three months is missing; my productivity is hovering in the lowest quadrant. I’ve been increasingly thinking and fantasizing about quitting. It’s a completely stupid and irrational idea. If I don’t pull myself together, I could get fired. I especially don’t need my supervisors or colleagues to know how much I’m struggling.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: You’re not alone. Speaking for myself, the past several months have felt like all my school-based anxiety dreams about surprise exams and forgotten assignments. I’ve been dropping balls like a drunk juggler. Goldfish have better recall than I do.Work advice: Pandemic stress is bringing out our boss's nasty sideThis all started to make sense when I stumbled across the term “allostatic load,” which refers to the mental and physical effects of constant exposure to stress. Symptoms include forgetfulness, mind fog, apathy, detachment and reduced ability to function or focus.   Between the coronavirus pandemic, civil rights conflicts, and, well, all of 2020 so far, our stress-response systems have been on high alert. Even if you’re not consciously thinking or worrying about these stressors, you’re being bombarded with “this is not normal” danger signals every time you log in to a Zoom meeting, turn on the news or wait your turn on a carefully spaced floor decal while wearing a mask. Processing those signals drains your battery, leaving you fatigued, exhausted and numb.As if that weren’t stressful enough, “employers are in the driver’s seat now in a way that they haven’t been for a decade,” says Jim Weinstein, a psychotherapist and career counselor in Washington. With unemployment high, “employers can be more demanding than ever,” so workers “need to be extra careful about making moves that could be seen by your employer as a signal of diminished capacity.”And yet the harder your brain is working, the less you seem to get done, and the more effort everything requires. Anyone whose life has been upended and expectations reset by illness, trauma or grief — or even happy changes, such as becoming a parent — knows the frustration of wanting to perform higher-function duties with a brain stuck in primitive survival mode.   I understand your reluctance to let anyone see that struggle, but trying to cover up and power through is only going to compound the stress. Honest conversations with friends, family or a therapist can bring invisible stressors to light and perhaps uncover strategies to manage them.Work Advice: Coronavirus stress: How to hang on when your job is wearing you downAnd don’t rule out being open with your boss and colleagues. One twisted upside to this pandemic is that, unlike a private struggle with mental health or a personal life change, everyone else is being subjected to the same stressors as you. Obviously it depends on their capacity for empathy, but you may be surprised by how much grace they’re willing to extend to someone sharing their own experience.In the meantime, do what you can to reduce your obligations and expectations. Story continues below  Accept that you’re not functioning at maximum efficiency. Write down even simple to-dos that you used to juggle in your head. Take more frequent breaks. Set smaller, more manageable goals. Be even more mindful about eating, sleeping and moving to restore your depleted reserves.AdvertisementReassure yourself and others that you will get the important stuff done, even if it takes longer. Be as gentle and patient with yourself as you would be with a loved one who’s recovering from surgery. And again, know that this struggle is a normal response, it’s not your fault, and most important, you’re far from alone.Read more:Inspired Life: Tackling your to-do list? Me neither.

49,"August 13, 2020","Reader: Early in March, my husband was laid off because of the coronavirus pandemic. The owner of the company told laid-off employees he would pay them their equivalent hourly rate to keep in touch with clients and complete certain tasks during this time. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightAfter the Cares Act was passed and the employer received a Paycheck Protection Program loan, my husband was rehired. He asked about payment for the hours he worked during his layoff, but didn’t push it because he was relieved to be back on payroll. He still has not been paid for those hours.The loan period ended with no formal announcement from the owner, who kept assigning tasks and expecting follow-up. My husband was essentially told there was no money, but if he didn’t do the work, the business would fail and he would be left with no job after the pandemic.   My husband was angry but felt stuck. So he has kept working a couple of hours a day. Now he’s being told to meet with clients at their convenience, still with no compensation. He wants to walk away, but he is concerned that the owner will then claim that he quit and make him ineligible for the unemployment benefits we need to make ends meet. Is that possible? And is there any way we can hold the owner accountable?The controversial $600 unemployment aid debate, explainedKarla: Back up. To persuade your husband to keep working without pay, his boss is warning that he could end up losing a job that … doesn’t pay him? Points for chutzpah.It’s not clear whether your husband has been laid off a second time or is technically still employed. What is clear is that his (former?) boss has not paid him for work he has already done, and so the boss is in no position to be making demands or threats.   In any case, your husband should do two things immediately: Report his (former?) employer to your state labor agency and the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division for unpaid wages, and reapply for unemployment benefits. Even if he’s still technically employed, he may be eligible for unemployment benefits if he is earning less (or no) income because of the pandemic.After that, I strongly recommend your husband consult an employment lawyer to help him decide whether he should keep meeting with clients and recording his unpaid hours for now, and whether it’s worth taking this dispute to court, individually or with colleagues. For example, a wage theft law that recently took effect in Virginia allows unpaid workers to sue their employers for damages equal to up to three times the value of their missing wages, business law partner Declan Leonard of Berenzweig Leonard says.Uber and Lyft must make their drivers in California full employees, judge rulesIt’s possible that your husband’s boss is holding off on announcing a layoff in the hopes that Congress will approve another round of PPP loans to keep his business afloat. A Senate proposal is being considered that would allow small businesses to apply for an additional PPP loan if they can show their revenue has dropped by 50 percent. If it passes and your husband’s boss obtains more funding, he might intend to use it to catch up on back wages.But in the meantime, how does the old saying go? Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, hear from my lawyer."
50,"August 20, 2020","Reader: I work for a nonprofit that serves low-income families in some of the poorest neighborhoods in our city. We have three neighborhood sites directly serving the community and one small administrative office where I worked until the lockdown in March. My job was not designed as a work-from-home position, but we successfully adjusted. However, our community service staff must be physically on site to do their jobs, putting their health at risk.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightWe recently learned that our state has a law requiring employers to reimburse employees for work-related expenditures, which may include remote-working expenses. Since we’ve been asked to keep working from home until 2021, I asked if it would be possible to provide a stipend or reimbursement for a home office setup (I don’t have a desk or proper office chair) and Internet expenses. I was made to feel guilty for asking and was told the health concerns and needs of the on-site workers take priority. In addition, I was told that reimbursing remote staff simply isn’t “in the budget” and that I should feel lucky to be able to perform my duties at home. I never intended to undermine the issues our on-site staff are facing. Should I just shut up and allow more important issues to be addressed?   Karla: Even for cash-starved  nonprofit organizations struggling to get by in a pandemic, “That’s not in our budget” is not an excuse for failing to comply with the law.This nonprofit isn’t promptly paying its workers. Should she blow the whistle when she leaves?And I take a dim view of anyone using “Count yourself lucky” as a cudgel. Yes, you’re lucky to have a job that can be done remotely. Your front-line colleagues are lucky to have paying jobs when so many have lost theirs. Everyone who still enjoys  coronavirus-free health is lucky. For that matter, your employer is lucky to be able to get work out of you without being responsible for disinfecting your workspace. You can be mindful of your relative advantages and still be entitled to, say, a functional computer or a chair that doesn’t wreck your back so you can do your job.Pandemic or no, reimbursement policies for work-related employee expenditures “should already be on employers’ radar,” according to Lenore Horton, an employment attorney with FisherBroyles. When employees bring up concerns or questions about work-related costs, says Horton, “the answer’s not to just swat them away.” Rather, employers should take the opportunity to recognize and fix the gap between what their policies cover and what the law requires. And many employers have voluntarily stepped up with home-office reimbursements and allowances since the coronavirus pandemic forced them to send workers home.   Still, for every worker enjoying a home-office subsidy, others are perching uncomfortably at their kitchen tables and using portable hotspots for Internet access. Federal law requires reimbursement only when required expenses push a worker’s earnings below minimum wage. The rest is up to states and individual employers.Expense retorts: Workers question paying for trade shows and bad coffeeI’m guessing you have neither the resources nor the moral inclination to engage your employer in a costly legal battle. But might your employer be willing to let you borrow an unoccupied chair and table from the office? Or help negotiate a deal with another business that may be downsizing its inventory? An employer that at least tries to support its workers is going to reap more loyalty and productivity than one that seeks to shame them into silence.Pro tip: Hold on to your utility bills and receipts for any work-related purchases. Even though the federal deduction for unreimbursed business expenses was eliminated in 2018 for individual employees, some states still allow you to deduct them.  ==Last week, I recommended contacting an employment attorney for help recovering unpaid wages. Readers pointed out that someone without income is going to have a hard time affording legal support. Fair point! Here are a few resources for low- or no-cost legal aid: Free Legal Answers, sponsored by the American Bar Association.Your state’s bar association should have a directory of lawyers, including those offering low- or no-cost consultations.Legal rights advocacy groups often sponsor legal clinics and workshops for the communities they serve.

51,"September 3, 2020","Reader: After starting out in financial services, I changed to a career 10 years ago as a retail store manager in women’s fashion. It has the usual downsides of retail: long hours, customer service situations and high turnover. However, it has also been filled with incredible co-workers and entrepreneurship. Being a leader in retail means being well-rounded, resilient, hands-on and adaptable. It’s an amazing education.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThanks to the coronavirus pandemic, staying in my industry is not a long-term strategy. I am open to trying something new, taking a moderate pay cut and taking some classes. But employers are a lot less open to me. There seems to be a stigma about retail workers. I have been interviewing for several months now and I’m constantly underestimated. I’ve been told, point blank, that I have no experience in office management, accounting, HR, interior design, and even sales.   Did they not read my résumé? I run a workplace. I build relationships with other businesses. I create profit-and-loss statements. I have hired, trained and fired people. I can design a store, stockroom or office. My paycheck depends on my ability to sell things people don’t need. I do event planning, project management and digital marketing. All of this is clearly stated on my résumé.What would you recommend I do to appear more qualified and to overcome the service industry stigma? Ivanka Trump wasn’t completely wrong when she said “find something new.” She just left out the all-important issue of “how?”Michelle Singletary: Ivanka Trump’s Find Something New career campaign is more hype than helpKarla: For some, the “how” is to be born or marry into enough wealth and privilege that regardless of qualifications or failed ventures, you’ll never want for opportunities. The rest of us slobs have to wing it.   Ask yourself this: How do you sell customers items they don’t need? Presumably you select and promote pieces of inventory that fit the market, the season and your target demographic, showing customers how the product fills needs and solves problems they didn’t even realize they had.And how do you build relationships with other businesses? You probably study their operations and challenges so you can make clear how partnering with your business will benefit them.Now apply these tactics to selling yourself.Your inventory of skills and talents is thorough and impressive. But from your letter, I suspect you’re falling into the common résumé trap of listing everything — everything — you “can do” and “have been responsible for.” That kind of résumé can get you in the door (and has!), but to close the deal with the human decision-makers, you need to highlight your most relevant skills and show how they fill the employer’s needs.   What problems have you solved, what improvements have you made, and how do those results translate into dollars? More important, how can you solve and improve and generate those dollar signs for [fill in potential employer’s name here]? How will partnering with you benefit them? If hiring managers are blinded by stigma against retail professionals, you’re going to have to fill in the blanks for them.But maybe your challenge as a retail professional isn’t stigma, but market saturation. You’re one among thousands of retail job-seekers right now. So let me switch analogies midstream and introduce you to the idea of “lifeboat jobs.”Pandemic bankruptcies: A running list of retailers that have filed for Chapter 11As explained in a recent report by labor market analytics firm BurningGlass, a lifeboat job is one whose requirements overlap with your current skill set and will give you the opportunity to transfer to more stable opportunities.   So what might some of those lifeboat jobs look like? According to a recent report by LinkedIn, demand for certain professionals has increased during the pandemic: occupancy planners, life coaches, personal shoppers and coronavirus-exposure trackers. Two of those — occupancy planners and personal shoppers — strike me as jobs you could transfer to with minimal training or retooling of your skills.Of course, those jobs may not interest you or may involve a bigger pay cut or steeper learning curve than you’d like. They’re just an example of how, if you get creative about connecting what’s needed with what you already offer — and make those connections obvious to hiring managers — you might find something new.Finally, if you decide you want to look for entrepreneurial opportunities in the women’s fashion industry, I have just two words for you: business pajamas."
52,"September 10, 2020","  I work at a global nonprofit that hires a lot of recent college graduates from around the world. They are “the best and brightest” and have great careers ahead of them.This is usually their first professional job.

However, we never have enough openings for all qualified employees to get the promotions they deserve.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightLike most American organizations, we plan for about 20 percent staff turnover each year. This isn’t the norm in some employees’ home countries. I’d like to provide useful career advice to these young people, but I don’t know how to tell them to start looking for a new job if they want to move up. Our employer would be happy to keep them in their current roles as long as possible. What’s a good mentor to do?   Karla: I’ve said this before, but for many new grads, transitioning into their first “real” job is like stepping off a moving walkway: Suddenly it takes twice as much effort to see half as much progress. And I wrote that with U.S. graduates in mind, so the impatience and frustration you’re observing doesn’t seem to be tied to national origin.‘It’s emotionally exhausting’: Grad student workers feel the stress of the pandemicWhen it comes to mentoring these quality hires when they express disappointment about promotions, your explanation is fine, with a subtle addendum: “Unfortunately, there are never enough openings for everyone to get the promotions they deserve. Sometimes people get tired of competing for those few slots and decide to look for opportunities elsewhere. It really depends on whether you feel you’re getting what you need from this job.” If someone doesn’t see the value in gaining depth of experience without a shiny job title attached, you won’t be able to convince them of it.Work Advice: I crushed grad school, but my first 'real' job is crushing meAnd you may also have a role to fill as a mediator with management. If you’re hearing grumblings about poor retention, you’re uniquely placed to communicate new hires’ concerns and suggest ways the firm can help them find more meaningful work or develop new skills. Hiring the best and brightest means getting great results — but remember, they didn’t become the best and brightest by staying content with whatever they’re offered.     Prior to covid, I already lacked a full workload in my revenue-generating position at a reputable cultural institution. As a junior nonexempt employee, I had been collecting a full-time paycheck even though I typically have had only enough work to fill 25 to 30 hours per week. There are few opportunities for stretch assignments or on-the-job learning. I raised the issue and was told, “you add a lot of value — but you’re so productive that we don’t know what to do with you the rest of the time,” followed by busywork assignments and vague promises of more substantive work.I was interviewing for other jobs until the coronavirus pandemic hit mid-March. It was devastating to see great prospects evaporate overnight as institutions shuttered. There will be no raises this year, and I will likely end up with no personal time, as we are now being told to use personal leave to bridge the gap if we don’t have enough work to fill our schedules. Some of my colleagues are working feverishly to move our offerings to virtual platforms, while my tasks require even less time than before.I know it’s a privilege to still be working, and I ought to hold on to my paycheck. It feels fiscally irresponsible to be paying a full-time employee for part-time work, and it feels unfair to me as an employee who works hard and wants to grow and advance. I’m struggling to adjust my deflated attitude and expectations. Is it selfish to feel like I’m wasting my time with this employer?   Karla: At least you own that being overpaid and underworked doesn’t sound like the biggest problem to have right now. And if there’s one thing we can reasonably be selfish about, it’s how we spend our time in exchange for income.Until the market recovers, there are two directions you can go to alleviate that feeling of selfishness about your situation:— Take less. Use your paid leave or ask to be moved to a part-time schedule so you’re not receiving any pay you haven’t earned. You’ll be helping keep costs down, but more important, you’ll be reclaiming your non-work time to pursue other interests, guilt-free. (Just make sure those interests don’t violate your employment contract.)— Give more. Contact the colleagues struggling to migrate online and ask how you can lighten their load — contingent on your supervisor’s approval, of course. Whether you end up with more busywork or a learning opportunity, you’ll be banking valuable goodwill and a reputation for initiative."

I’ve moved to complete telework due to the pandemic, which I’m not sure changes things. I find the Hatch Act to be confusing and vague, and I’m wary of asking the ethics office at my agency since I’m not sure if I could get in trouble for asking.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Even if you’re not a political junkie or living within the gravitational pull of our nation’s capital, you may have seen or heard the term “Hatch Act” more frequently in recent weeks. The law, enforced by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, prohibits federal employees — other than the president and vice president — from taking part in certain political activities, or using their official position to influence partisan elections or advance partisan causes.   Federal employees are either “further restricted” or “less restricted” under the Hatch Act. Further restricted employees, such as federal intelligence and law enforcement officials, are under “24/7” prohibition from participating in political activities, on or off the clock. Less restricted employees — like this week’s reader — have more freedoms in general, but navigating the rules can be tricky, and violating them can mean losing your job.As Trump appointees flout the Hatch Act, civil servants who get caught get punishedAna Galindo-Marrone, chief of the Hatch Act Unit at the Office of Special Counsel since 2000, says inquiry into Hatch Act rules “typically ramps up around this time of year” around volunteering, canvassing, attending rallies and other election-related activities. This year, Galindo-Marrone’s office has fielded an increased number of inquiries from younger workers looking to volunteer as election judges to replace older volunteers wary of exposure to the novel coronavirus. Because so many federal employees are working remotely during the pandemic, Galindo-Marrone’s office has also had to clarify how the Hatch Act applies to telecommuting. Even if you’re not physically at your federal workplace, you are still on duty during work hours. The office has also issued guidance on expressing support for or opposition to issue-advocacy groups such as Black Lives Matter, which, the office says, is not a partisan political group, so it’s not subject to Hatch Act restrictions. However, your agency may have its own rules about issue advocacy at work.Social media interactions are a hot topic. “We have found plenty of memes and retweets that some might have found to be funny, but that still constitute political activity” and should not be forwarded or distributed by federal employees on duty or in a federal building, said Galindo-Marrone. “It doesn’t have to be campaign material to constitute political activity.”Work Advice: Can an employer ask job seekers about their political views?So what about texting voters for a political campaign on your own time, using your own phone? As a less restricted employee, Galindo-Marrone said, you are probably in the clear under the Hatch Act as long as you are:   not on duty.not in a federal building, whether or not you are on duty.not using a government vehicle.not volunteering in your official capacity or wearing a uniform or insignia indicating your official title and position, but appearing in your personal capacity.not soliciting, accepting or receiving political contributions or engaging in fundraising.But remember, that’s only under the Hatch Act. Galindo-Marrone cautions that your agency may have stricter policies that you still have to follow. For example, the Hatch Act has not yet been updated to address smartphones and other personal devices. But your agency probably has detailed restrictions and policies you need to adhere to, especially if you use your phone for any kind of official business.If you’re still not certain whether you’re allowed to participate in an activity, and you’re concerned that simply raising the question with your agency’s ethics office will place you under suspicion, you can research FAQs, advisory opinions and other Hatch Act resources at www.osc.gov, or confidentially contact the Hatch Act Unit’s hotline at 800-854-2824 or hatchact@osc.gov."

WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightSoon after I started working, the executive director (my direct supervisor) and another director started taking their masks off. A third director only wears a face shield, which is not recommended by the CDC as an effective alternative. People come into my office without masks. In staff meetings, people pull down their masks to talk. In addition to the health concern, I feel disrespected anytime I see the lower half of someone’s face. I feel like they’re saying, “I don’t care about you or your family.” (I live with my parents.)Covid-19 etiquette: A comprehensive guideI spoke with one of the directors and my boss about the lack of masks. They apologized and told me to “call them out on it” if I see them not wearing masks. Things got better for a few days, but unsurprisingly they slipped back into their old habits. There’s no HR and no office above my boss. I refuse to be the mask police, but I’m really uncomfortable, and the anxiety is weighing on me. Not so fast, urban exodus: Coronavirus could make New York and San Francisco great places to live againKarla: So essentially, your bosses are abdicating their responsibility to maintain a safe work environment, opting instead to nominate a junior staffer to be their shoulder cricket. No matter how politely or persistently you chirp, you cannot hope to pierce that kind of blind, selfish indifference. Not that they’re intentionally disrespecting you; it’s just that their convenience and comfort outweigh their sense of self-preservation or obligation to the greater good.    Your managers should count themselves lucky you haven’t tipped off state authorities (assuming they care), local media, and the community they serve about their lax behind-the-scenes coronavirus-prevention standards. But as you say, you’re not the mask police, and you have neither the authority nor the job security to fill that role. You also may not have the stomach just now for putting your paycheck in jeopardy by escalating the matter outside the company.Fortunately, where common sense and self-awareness fall short, etiquette and social conventions can step in. In addition to being a key component in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, wearing masks has become shorthand for indicating respect for others. A whole system of “covidiquette” is evolving around face masks. And the time-honored way of dealing with those who refuse to adhere to etiquette is for you to adhere even tighter.Pre-Pandemic Work Advice: Can I require employees to get flu shots or wear masks at work?You can remind others of their obligations directly — “Oh hey, would you mind grabbing a mask before we meet?”— or indirectly, if you’re reluctant to call out their carelessness, by being relentlessly, visibly vigilant about your own habits. For example:   Always have your face mask on, and have extras available to offer.Keep a giant pump of hand sanitizer and a container of wipes out on your desk, where you might ordinarily place a community candy bowl.If telecommuting is not an option, stay in your personal workspace and out of common areas as much as possible. Arrange your seat and guest seating to promote safe distancing.Ask your boss if you can join meetings by video from your desk. Even if he doesn’t allow it, he’ll have no excuse to act surprised when you sit or stand, masked, in the most isolated corner of the room.Silently reinforce desired behavior through visual cues. Step back when someone approaches you to talk. When speaking with someone whose mask is down, casually touch or tug on the ear straps of your own mask, even if it doesn’t need adjusting. Smooth sanitizer on your hands before you pass a paper or pen to someone.If you’re worried about seeming obsessive, you can laugh it off — “If I give everyone covid-19, I’ll never get promoted!”— or plead filial piety: “I promised my parents I’d be super careful.” Or just say straight out that because one case of the coronavirus has already been reported, you are taking no chances. Then keep doing exactly what you’re doing to protect yourself and your family.And, of course, follow the usual precautions outside the office, including changing clothes and washing up when you get home.I know it’s exhausting and unfair to have to make an antiseptic spectacle of yourself to compensate for others’ thoughtlessness. But when you can’t rely on the folks in charge to make the minimum effort to keep you safe, and you’re not ready or able to quit, the next most effective defense is in your own hands."
55,"October 1, 2020","Reader: Two people in our five-person office have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Our boss found out over the weekend, but didn’t tell us until we found out from one of the infected workers and confronted the boss. We have our own offices, we wear masks, and we eat in our own spaces. We share a copy room and workrooms. We are angry at the boss for not telling us about the positive cases and not letting us work from home. Isn’t our employer required to notify us when someone at work tests positive for the coronavirus?WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Employers in this pandemic have to walk a fine line between keeping employees informed and causing needless anxiety, according to Susan Wiltsie, an employment law partner with Hunton Andrews Kurth who specializes in Occupational Safety and Health Administration compliance. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend notifying individuals who have had “close contact” with a coronavirus-positive person — defined as being within six feet for at least 15 minutes while the person was considered contagious (within 48 hours before symptom onset or, if no symptoms occur, 48 hours before the test was taken).CDC's credibility is eroded by internal blunders and external attacks as coronavirus vaccine campaigns loomUnder those guidelines, an infected person who has had no recent contact or interactions with co-workers may not present a risk that requires notification, and notifying the entire workforce in that case may cause more stress than benefit, Wiltsie notes.   That said, your anger is understandable, especially if you have or live with someone who has a high-risk medical condition. Anecdotal reports from people who have fallen ill despite taking thorough precautions, combined with ever-changing information on how the virus spreads, plus variables outside our personal control such as others’ behavior and environmental sanitation — and, most troubling, reports of possible political interference with our most trusted source of public health information, the CDC itself — make it reasonable to want to take extra precautions.Employers have a duty to provide a safe workplace. While reasonable minds may differ on the exact measures, an employer that fails to show it is making every reasonable effort to keep workers safe is going to face internal turmoil and possibly legal repercussions. Several meatpacking plants have been fined recently over lax coronavirus prevention and notification measures. OSHA itself is “receiving an astounding number of complaints” about employers, says Wiltsie, and is facing criticism and lawsuits arising from its enforcement of worker safety laws during the pandemic.Meatpacking workers file lawsuit against OSHA, accusing agency of failing to keep them safeSo even though employers might be inclined to hold off on announcing covid-19 outbreaks to avoid causing panic or stigmatizing infected workers, a certain amount of transparency might be in order to retain their workers’ trust. Wiltsie recommends the following approach when employers learn of a case of coronavirus infection among their workers:   1. Perform contact tracing to determine who in the workplace may have come into direct contact with the infected person.2. Privately contact those individuals at risk, without disclosing the identity of the infected person (confidentiality is required by the Americans With Disabilities Act).3. Make a general announcement to the rest of the workforce that a case of novel coronavirus has been confirmed, that people believed to be at risk of exposure have been notified, and that anyone who has not already been personally contacted is not believed to be at risk.That approach, according to Wiltsie, “threads the needle so that you don’t have unnecessary stress on people who are not at risk.”Story continues below  And, of course, time is of the essence, before the virus — and the news about it — has a chance to spread.AdvertisementPro tip: If you have a medical condition and are concerned about coronavirus exposure at work, consider making a doctor-endorsed plea under the ADA for additional protections, such as remote work or an isolated workspace. If your employer is willfully refusing to comply with state mandates on covid-19 protection, consider contacting your attorney general’s office or public health department. Also, retaliating against workers who raise safety concerns is illegal."
56,"October 8, 2020","Reader: I quit my job last year after a new boss took over. We had numerous disputes, she threatened to terminate me, and I decided it would be best to leave.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI’ve had over 25 unsuccessful interviews since then, many in positions I was easily qualified for. Recently I set up a second interview with an employer, who called two days later to tell me they wouldn’t be filling the position. With 15 years of experience, I find it baffling that so many have passed me over. This has been going on since at least last fall, so the coronavirus pandemic is not to blame. I know I sound paranoid, but is it possible that my former boss is bad-mouthing me? I don’t list her as a reference, but the employer is on my résumé, since I worked there for five years. Would potential employers call her just to check on my résumé? Is there any way to find out if a former boss is sabotaging you?   Karla: It’s possible your former boss is shivving you, or even just giving a lukewarm reference that says everything between the lines. But before acting on that assumption, let’s back up and eliminate other possibilities.You’re landing interviews, so clearly you’re making a good first impression. It sounds like the common breaking point is post-interview, when hiring managers who like what they’ve seen so far might start digging a little deeper into your backstory and your references. The pandemic may not be directly to blame for your lack of opportunities, but it has created a competitive environment where employers can afford to reject candidates with any marks on their record.The covid-19 recession is the most unequal in modern U.S. historySo what marks do you have against you? “Search me,” you say? Excellent idea. Plug your name into Google and see what pops up. Use your browser’s “incognito” mode, and maybe ask friends to run some searches as well, so you can get the outsider’s viewpoint. You may uncover damaging things being said about you — or, more likely, you may see damaging things you yourself have posted or shared on social media that ended up with a broader audience than you intended. If so, do what you can to clean up those tracks.   Once you’re done checking yourself, then move on to what your references may be saying about you. Even though you don’t list your boss specifically as a reference, people calling the employer may still end up speaking with her — especially if it’s a small business or if she’s a big figure in your industry.Work Advice: How do you handle negative references?For a fee, reference-checking services can find out firsthand what your former boss is telling prospective employers by posing as another employer or someone conducting a background check. I’m not above suggesting that route, but it’s rather like hiring a private investigator. One, some are more reputable and thorough than others, and two, it might be overkill; you don’t always need to prove that the worst is happening before taking preventive measures against it. Yes, if your old boss is campaigning against you, a cease-and-desist letter from a lawyer could put an end to it. But the simpler, cheaper route would be to line up enough positive references to counter any negativity.Track down your original boss, the one who was presumably happy with your work. Comb your professional network for colleagues and acquaintances who are willing to make introductions and maybe talk you up. Consider working with a recruiter, who may be able to help bypass obstacles and polish your narrative to make you more marketable to prospective employers.   And while you’re polishing, you might engage in some reflection about the “numerous disputes” between you and your former boss. How volatile were they? What was their substance? How might she characterize them? Acknowledging other angles might help you anticipate and defuse attempts to torpedo your prospects.Pro tip: It’s a common misconception that former employers can’t legally do more than confirm basic details about your employment. Employers often make that practice their policy to minimize the risk of lawsuits, but they aren’t prohibited from saying negative things that are truthful."

They recently rekindled their connection. She is now neglecting her job to do midday outings with him. She has also taken a couple of side projects and is more invested in those than in her current rent-paying employment. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI have tried to talk to her about how she needs to evaluate her priorities, making sure she is not neglecting a promising career that she claimed to be passionate about before this man came back into her life. She has ignored my advice and is becoming extremely irritable not only to me, but also to other co-workers, often snapping at them in online meetings. Story continues below  We have different managers, but we work on the same team, and I have a good relationship with her boss. What do I do?Top workplaces 2020: How the concept of work has shifted.Karla: You don’t mention the covid-19 pandemic, but it’s not a stretch to imagine that the work/home/school boundary disruptions currently afflicting so many of us are exacerbating tensions in your life as well. For those of us working from home, the pandemic has collapsed the separate spheres of our lives into one tiny fishbowl, highlighting conflicts and irritations we were previously able to manage or distract ourselves from as we transitioned from one space to another.AdvertisementIf I had to guess, your roommate/co-worker’s instinct under this forced enmeshment is to seek escape routes, while yours is to preserve stability. Both can be valid responses, but boundaries are more important now than ever if you’re going to coexist. To revive an analogy I’ve used before, you need to envision your life with this person as a bento food box: contained but compartmentalized. You need barriers to keep her wasabi out of your dumplings and your soy sauce out of her rice.The Future of Work: The coronavirus has abruptly changed the way we work--and some of those changes may be foreverEach of you is responsible for your own career, personal relationships and well-being, and yours alone. When the results of her choices spill over into your career, relationships and well-being, you are entitled to say something to reinforce your boundaries.Story continues below  For example, you are not responsible for keeping her on a promising career path she seems to have lost interest in, or monitoring when and why she goes offline. But you are allowed to speak up when:AdvertisementHer contributions to projects you’re working on are late or incomplete.She can’t pay her share of the rent in full and on time.Her relationship or any spillover drama from it disrupts your work or personal time — or safety.Her snappishness prevents the two of you from communicating effectively with each other.A New Year's resolution to set better work boundariesNotice that these are all about effects on you — not about the suspected causes, such as her midday dalliances or shifting priorities. No shoehorning in career advice when the issue is that she’s late with her share of the power bill. If outside leverage is needed to resolve a work matter, apply it through the proper chain of command: your manager, who can then talk to her manager. Even if your outside perspective on her life is accurate and the correct choices seem obvious, they’re not your choices to make. State the effects, and let her worry about the causes.There is one area where boundaries are a little less rigid than those between roommates or co-workers. If you genuinely think her well-being is in jeopardy, or if she seems to be spiraling into an unhealthy emotional state, friendship gives you a pass to say something — “Are you all right? You don’t seem yourself. I’m worried about you.” But then it also obligates you to listen to the answer without unsolicited advice or judgment, with the simple goal of understanding."
58,"October 22, 2020","Reader: I work for my state government as a first-responder, interacting daily with unmasked members of the public who would cough on me while showing symptoms. Despite having a flu shot and being extremely careful about covid-19 prevention at home, in April I came down with severe flu-like symptoms. I tested negative for the novel coronavirus a couple days after my symptoms appeared and later tested negative for coronavirus antibodies. My physician said I was likely a false negative. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightMy symptoms have gotten worse and are typical of what is being reported for covid-19 “long-haulers” — recurring fever, debilitating fatigue, inability to concentrate, headache, dizziness, body aches and more. I’m being evaluated for chronic fatigue syndrome, but my doctor and other specialists I have seen are convinced that my condition is a direct result of the unidentified viral infection earlier in the year. Seeking clarity: Redefining work in the covid pandemicMy employer has granted me short-term disability. When it runs out, I will be placed on long-term disability at 60 percent of my current salary. My employment will be terminated, and I will have to join my spouse’s health insurance plan.   I realize I’m fortunate compared to those without access to benefits or insurance. But this illness is devastating enough without the stress of potentially losing my career of 15+ years. If I was exposed to the coronavirus at work and it is the cause of my debilitating illness, are there other routes I should explore, such as workers’ compensation? How problematic is it that I never actually tested positive? What can I do to retain my job or financial security when I finally recover?Karla: Two red-hot ironies that sum up the American condition:1. You have dedicated years of your life to performing a job that may have derailed your career and life as you know it — and yet one of your main concerns is staying gainfully employed.Story continues below  2. Despite devastating illness, you consider yourself lucky to have access to financial support and health-care coverage thanks to your employment and your marital status.AdvertisementI’m not criticizing you, by any means. I’m lamenting a state of existence that demands so much yet compels people to feel grateful for so little.Elaine Weiss, lead policy analyst for income security and a specialist on workers’ compensation at the National Academy of Social Insurance, sees your story as an example of “why working in this country … for so many people is so precarious.” The coronavirus pandemic has illuminated just how “worker protection systems are inadequate,” says Weiss, and how vulnerable we all are.Work Advice: For some workplace disputes, calling a lawyer is just the best optionWorkers’ compensation is designed to provide no-fault support for people injured or sickened because of their work. But aside from known occupational diseases, such as black lung in miners, it’s generally difficult to claim workers’ comp for illness. As Weiss and other NASI colleagues discuss in a recent report, covid-19 in particular is hard to pin down as job-related because it’s highly contagious, common outside the workplace, and has a long latency period. But some categories of workers have a clear and disproportionate risk of exposure through their jobs.   For this reason, some states have begun lowering the burden of proof for certain categories of workers diagnosed with coronavirus so they can qualify for workers’ comp. These presumptions vary widely by state; some cover only front-line health-care professionals, while others include educators, warehouse workers, retail employees, meatpackers and other vulnerable groups. Of course, the NASI report notes, the more people these policies cover, the higher the burden on state systems.Unfortunately, these presumptions generally require a confirmed novel coronavirus diagnosis, which you don’t have. Even if you did, says Weiss, you would have a hard time qualifying for workers’ compensation unless your state of employment has adopted a covid-19 presumption that covers workers in your category.Still, says Weiss, a workers’ compensation lawyer “might not be a bad place to start.” Often you can get a low- or no-cost consultation to determine whether you have a case worth pursuing. And that lawyer may be able to direct you to other legal resources and specialists who can help you build your case for returning to work with accommodations (if that’s possible) or for securing and protecting your long-term disability benefits. Outside of consulting a lawyer, Weiss recommends checking out the Job Accommodation Network (askjan.org), the National Employment Law Project (nelp.org), and your state’s disability services agency website.And, of course, stay involved with your doctors — not only so they can document your eligibility for job accommodations or benefits, but also because right now, your health should be your top priority."
59,"October 29, 2020","Correction: An earlier version of this column included a letter from a reader that incorrectly asserted that their federal workplace granted parents additional paid leave under the Cares Act. While some federal employees have been granted additional paid leave during the pandemic, this has varied according to agency and was not a provision of the Cares Act. This has now been corrected.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightReader: Our federal workplace permits parents to work 75 percent of their hours (30 hours/week, any days or times) for the same pay. I’m glad not to lose my teammates and work friends, and glad they can better balance their personal lives and work, but this has translated to a heavy burden on those of us who are child-free. I’m overloaded, and the assignments just keep coming, with no legitimate-enough excuse to make my “no, thank you” stick. The constant narrative from leadership is what heroes parents are — and they are, but those of us without kids are doing so much heavy lifting, and we have families, too.    I know that even though parenthood is a choice, having kids at home during a pandemic wasn’t. As an employed, teleworking, snugly housed and safe person, I know I’m privileged. That said, my workplace feels very unequal right now. It sounds ugly out loud, but as a married woman without children, I’m losing my empathy and patience after months of being treated as though my time is therefore infinite. Karla: As I once said in response to a child-free worker disgruntled by parents working from home with kids: One worker’s right to work-life balance does not trump another’s.But that was in the Before Times, when children on conference calls were rare occurrences. Maternity leave could be planned around. Children eventually aged out of needing so much attention. Child-free workers had opportunities to stoke their careers and earnings. There was an ebb and flow to the imbalance.   But now we’re all paddling in quicksand, trying not to get sucked under. And there’s no solid ground in sight.Being an income-earning parent during this pandemic is hell. Parents — let’s be frank, moms — are, like you, buried in additional unpaid work they can’t turn down. If they’re like me, they’re also aware of all the ways they’re falling short and how every lost work-minute threatens their employability, their earning power and their child-free colleagues’ goodwill. They sure don’t feel like heroes. Covid-19 benefits for parents aren’t about balance; they’re about not drowning.Many of these women are leaving the workforce — at four times the rate of men. And all women, mothers or not, should be alarmed by that. We are not that far past the days when it was common — and legal — for employers to view all female job candidates as potential sunk costs — or the days before parenthood truly could be a choice.   But as you note, child-free workers can’t serve indefinitely as backup levees for our nation’s fragile support systems. Stretching the same salary over more hours isn’t technically a pay cut, but it certainly feels like one. And your diligence and child-free status are no guarantee against layoffs.Work Advice: Quarantine Life: Meetings outside business hours are becoming a constantAnd employers trying to stay afloat are having to reallocate resources and comply with new laws to accommodate a functionally reduced workforce.The few solutions I’ve seen revolve around managing expectations, adjusting priorities and supporting each other.For employers and managers, this means rethinking expectations and priorities and reducing demands to the essentials. It also means supporting employees in using flexibility and setting reasonable boundaries.Work Advice: My hours have been cut due to a coronavirus furlough, but my workload hasn’tAs for you, Reader: Know that “breaking down from overwork” and “too many tasks in too little time” are not “excuses” — they’re legitimate reasons. Determine the daily or weekly threshold at which you begin producing diminishing returns, and ask your boss for help setting priorities on what you can defer and what you should focus on before you hit that threshold.   Remember also that this isn’t the mommy wars of yore. It may help defuse resentment if you think of your parent co-workers as being incapacitated by the novel coronavirus, similar to someone on sick leave. They are as eager to return to normal as you are.Pro tip: For details on pandemic-related unemployment among women as well as recommendations for solutions, see “Women in the Workplace: Corporate America Is at a Critical Crossroads,” published by McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.org."

One message I received:WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightYour response was focused almost exclusively on the trials and tribulations of working mothers. Your justification falls flat in 2020 when men are taking on more and more of the child-rearing responsibilities. The reader’s question did not mention any specific gender. Is there a reason you think only women are burdened right now? BTW — I am female. [Writer requested not to be identified] Karla: Everyone is burdened now, both by external stressors — unemployment, increased workloads, financial straits — and internal stressors — anxiety, fear, insomnia.Story continues below  But article after survey after NPR series after labor statistics fact sheet indicate that women are losing paid work in far higher numbers than men. Some of it is because majority-female hospitality and retail front lines are hardest hit, but much is also due to mothers being fired or leaving because it is not possible to attend to both their jobs and their children.AdvertisementThis is not to say fathers aren’t affected and aren’t stepping up — but until the unemployment numbers show otherwise, it seems clear that women are disproportionately affected, and that motherhood is a significant contributing factor to this imbalance.As with parent-vs-child-free tensions at work, gender-based labor inequality was a problem in the Before Times — but in the pandemic, both are becoming unmanageable. Immediate village-level solutions start with lowering our expectations, setting boundaries, and looking after ourselves and each other.

When I had children, I got to work on time and left as soon as the day ended. Once I had an empty nest, I took on more hours so that parents of young children could focus on their family. There is an ebb and flow to life, and I feel fortunate I could make these adjustments. — Becca2AdvertisementReaders on solutions:We all need to ease up on the fake deadlines, realize that most of us are NOT saving lives with our white-collar office jobs, and give everyone a bit of a break.

Many of my co-workers who are parents are doing the unimaginable and still tackling so much, but others are bragging about going on a daily fall hike or other activities. Meanwhile, I’m sobbing into my keyboard over a spreadsheet. I did not read your initial column as taking any sides, but the reactions from other readers tell me I’m not alone in my strong feelings.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightYour point about thinking of the parents as being on a form of sick leave is well-taken, but some of the other suggested solutions are tougher to put into practice. If I ask my supervisors, they’ll tell me it’s fine to let some tasks fall by the wayside, but they all have different views on which tasks can be let go. Everyone is very nice, and my job is secure, but I was passed over for promotion this year, and I am terrified that if I let anything drop now, I’ll be skipped again in the next round of promotions. Virtual schooling has largely forced moms, not dads, to quit work.

But whatever their intent, you’re still feeling like Cinderella stuck at the hearth while everyone else is frolicking in the autumn leaves with their families.   As readers following this saga over the past few weeks have already observed, this is less about parent-versus-nonparent conflict and more about a lack of clear guidance on priorities at your workplace. If everything is important, then nothing is. And if that’s the case, you’ll have to set some priorities for yourself, starting with your mental health.Being a team player is one thing, but you’re carrying all the batons with no one to hand them off to. I respect your drive to stay on track for promotion in the After Times, but after seven months, it’s time to change your pace and settle in for the marathon.Silently, miserably plugging along on all the tasks dumped on you is not only an express train to breakdown — it’s also not guaranteed to pay off come promotion time. Your workplace may vary, but a dirty little secret many of us have had to learn the hard way in both the public and private sector is that reward is not always given in proportion to effort.   If your employer’s promotion process relies on seniority or other metrics unrelated to performance, no amount of uncomplaining diligence is likely to make you a better candidate — but, on the bright side, overlooking a few nonessential tasks won’t doom you, either.What a contested election means for the economy--and your walletIf you step back and study your workload from a strategic perspective — focusing on what’s high-profile, what makes the best use of your work skills, what’s most relevant to your department’s purpose or your personal goals, and what is most likely to catch the attention of people you’re looking to impress — I’m betting some projects will emerge as urgent must-dos and others will recede as nice-to-have-but-nonessential. Give the former the benefit of your most productive hours and focus; for the latter, give yourself permission to say, “I wasn’t able to get to that this week.”And schedule some time off for yourself, okay?

But those seem to be the options your chief executive prefers over the most direct solution.Ironically, with covid-19, there’s probably never been a better opportunity to find someone outside the organization who would gladly take your boss’s place. But your organization chief might not have the heart to fire anyone in this market, or she may be wary of making any move that could be read as age discrimination against an over-40 manager. (Such as, for example, attributing his learned helplessness to age. The Peter Principle transcends demographics.)Work Advice: Taking the wrong angle on 360-degree reviewsYour elaborate workarounds might even be compounding the problem. Until his incompetence affects her directly — say, with a sudden mass exodus of burned-out employees or a significant failure on his watch — she has little incentive to make further effort.   But an employer that isn’t willing to kick a bad boss out might be willing to nudge him upstairs.Even if no one wants your boss’s position, you all seem to have figured out how to divide his job among you already. How might your chief react if you and your colleagues diplomatically presented her with (1) specific examples of how the boss’s mismanagement has cost the company time, money or both, followed by (2) a coordinated plan to grant each of you ownership of a separate task or responsibility, with the bad boss’s revised job being to sit back and let you all make him look good?Your chance of success with this soft coup depends on how well you and your colleagues can organize, how receptive your new chief executive is to unsolicited business strategies, and how effectively she can persuade your boss to take a more hands-off role. A raise in exchange for doing the boss’s job would probably be out of the question; being allowed to do your job without his interference would have to be its own reward. If that seems like too many “ifs” for too little payoff, putting out feelers for a better opportunity at another employer might be the simplest solution for you, pandemic or no.     The wife of a friend of my boyfriend works in the same industry as I do and has been looking for a job.

You’re not a recruiter; you’re someone who granted a favor for an acquaintance. Even if she was your best friend and you sang her praises when making introductions, all communication beyond that point is strictly between the job seeker and the employer. Your following up will not help her chances of getting hired. And if she somehow made a bad impression, hounding your department head on her behalf won’t do you any favors. If your company fills its open positions, you might ask your boss if it’s all right to informally let your acquaintance know a decision has been made. But again, that’s the employer’s obligation — not yours."
63,"December 3, 2020","Reader: I work for a very small luxury travel agency that was already suffering due to the covid-19 pandemic. The owner of the company recently passed away, and we are heartbroken and completely freaked out. No one has been named next in command, and his family wants nothing to do with the business. We don’t even know if we’ll be paid out from the accounts. Also, quite a few trips are still booked in the coming months for clients who have zero idea what’s going on, and we don’t know what we’re allowed to tell them. We want to help ensure our travelers still get to go on their trips, but of course we can’t work for free and will eventually need to find other jobs to pay our bills. Can the company continue without its owner? What is the standard next step when something like this happens? It’s weighing on our consciences, and we know the owner would never have wanted to leave these customers high and dry. WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: If starting a business is about making a name for yourself, succession planning is often about whom you trust to carry on that name. But more than that, succession planning is “a continuing responsibility that you owe to employees and customers,” says Declan Leonard, attorney and partner at business law firm Berenzweig Leonard. As you’re seeing, even owners of small businesses “can really impact a lot of lives by not taking this responsibility seriously.”You will die. Don't exit leaving a hot mess behind.The good news, Leonard says, is that even if your late boss’s family has no interest in running the business, “everyone’s interests are aligned” in dispensing with it quickly and properly: “Employees want to get paid; clients want to know if they’re going to receive their services, or if a refund is in the works; and the heirs’ inheritances are in jeopardy if they don’t do this right.”   According to Leonard, your late boss’s business would be considered an asset of his estate; the executor or administrator of the estate has a fiduciary duty to preserve the value of that asset for the heirs, so “letting [the business] go down the tubes would be a dereliction of duty to the family, not to mention employees and clients.” And whatever the final decision — step in, sell or shutter — the best way to ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption and cost would be to keep current employees informed and involved in the process.If your late boss did not retain an accountant or lawyer for his business, Leonard recommends you find outwho is representing the estate so you can “go into collaboration mode” with that person. If the only way to get that information is from the bereaved family, you and your colleagues should nominate one person who can handle the situation with diplomacy and empathy. That person should explain that you all want to ensure your actions and client communications are consistent with how your boss’s family wants to handle the business. (You are, of course, also concerned about receiving the pay you’re legally entitled to, but there’s no need to harp on that point to still-grieving family members at this stage).Work Advice: The office is closing. Should the manager lead, or leave?Meanwhile, Leonard adds, you may want to collectively hire an attorney who can advise your group on your rights and obligations and who can serve as a single point of contact between you and the estate — and maybe apply leverage as needed.   Above all, until you receive direction on how to support the business, you should shift your focus to supporting yourself. Start your job search immediately, document all unpaid work hours, and retain copies of all client communications and contracts, in case of a dispute over back pay or refunds. No matter what happens to the business, you are entitled to be paid, but there’s no telling how long that process will take.I am sorry for your personal and professional losses, and for your grief compounded by stress and uncertainty.

Although 75 percent to 80 percent of U.S. businesses hosted holiday gatherings in 2019, that proportion has nearly inverted in 2020, with only 23 percent of employers planning to hold celebrations, according to surveys by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Budgets are tight, but we’ve gotten approval to send a small dessert treat to everyone’s home. We’ll get together to have a chat and something sugary, then we’ll end the day early. It’s nothing like the nice meal out we’d normally have, but we’re hoping it will let people relax a little bit.Our state government agency generally has an annual awards banquet off-site in December. This year we will be celebrating with catered box lunches at work in our own cubicles. Once we weather this, things can go back to normal — if we are all still here. That’s the prize I’m keeping my eye on.And some are celebrating with rewards, rather than gatherings:When I became supervisor, among the benefits I promised my staff was a day off instead of forced conversation and bad food. This year I plan to email everyone in my department a $20 gift card to a local pizzeria so they can enjoy dinner on me on their own time.We are being shipped “limited edition” company logo blankets and each got $50 added to our merch accounts to buy company-branded clothing. (I guess it’s the (trademarked) thought that counts? — Karla)Despite my cynical predictions, Zoom fatigue hasn’t completely destroyed everyone’s appetite for online work gatherings.“People are trying to emulate what they’ve done in the past, a cocktail party atmosphere where the CEO makes an inspirational speech,” says Michael Alexis, CEO of event-planning company Teambuilding.com. “But they’re also realizing they need a really strong element of engagement.”When the pandemic all but eliminated demand for his company’s off-kilter museum tours and guacamole-making contests, Alexis shifted his business model online. Now his team hosts 90-minute Zoom holiday parties featuring trivia contests, virtual gift swaps, and games such as “Gingerbread Wars.” Instead of paying for party hosts to travel and transport party supplies to employers’ sites, the company’s costs now go primarily to Zoom fees and shipping party kits and prizes to attendees’ homes. And while hosts previously could run maybe two events per day in person, now they can host as many as four or five online, turning a gig into something more like a full-time job. That, Alexis says, means more paid hours and benefits for his party hosts — many of them actors, comedians and other performers whose day jobs in arts and entertainment disappeared in the pandemic.And how are the virtual gatherings going over with employees? Alexis shares this testimonial from a participant: “For 90 minutes I forgot everything that’s going on in the world right now.” Which, if you ask me, is as good as it gets.Year in review: If you’re a former Work Advice seeker with an update to share, we’d all love to hear it!

66,"December 30, 2020","Reader: In my career, I’ve had two narcissistic, verbally abusive bosses, so bad that team members under both bosses ended up needing therapy. After the second experience, I became self-employed to avoid working for other people. I’d like to make a career change, but the risk of winding up with another abusive boss has me very anxious, as does the idea of a prospective employer talking to my former bosses. One boss stabbed me in the back after I left and was cold and rude when I reached out more recently.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightTwo questions:What can I ask during the interview to get true insight into the workplace environment to ensure that supervisors are not abusive?What do I say to interviewers about the places where I worked?Karla: “Narcissism,” like “psychopath” or “OCD,” is a term that gets tossed around even though it may not be clinically accurate. But I’m going to assume that you mean your former bosses exhibit core traits and behaviors commonly associated with narcissism, such as grandiose thinking or behavior, lack of empathy, sense of entitlement, inability to admit fault or failure, and exploitativeness. They may have tried to establish themselves as superior, through arrogant self-promotion or by tearing down competitors. Narcissists tend to be charismatic and good at drawing fans and followers — until they’re crossed or called out on their behavior, at which point they become cold and punitive. And if you aren’t immediately thinking of any public figures who fit that description, you may have been in a four-year coma.Jennifer Rubin: Trump's narcissism has never been more dangerousThe fact that you’ve had two such bosses indicates two possibilities:   You’re working in an industry that attracts and rewards narcissists in particular, and/orYou’re especially vulnerable to narcissists, possibly because you are empathetic or were raised by them.It is possible to work for narcissists, “as long as you see them for who they are and realize they will never change the way they operate,” says Jim Weinstein, a licensed psychotherapist and career counselor. But even if you think you know what you’re getting into, working around a narcissist may take a bigger toll on your soul than you realize.As someone who’s been through this particular grinder at least twice, you’re better off avoiding it altogether. The good news is, even in a narcissist-flooded industry, it’s possible to seek out islands of sanity to land on.So how can you detect narcissists among prospective bosses? Probably not in the interview, where they’ll be on a full charm offensive, Weinstein says. Instead, he says, you should investigate the company and the boss on Glassdoor and Google, to see if warning signs surface in discussion boards or press coverage. On LinkedIn, locate the person’s profile and follow the trail of connections to see if it overlaps with anyone in your network who might have insights.   Elliott B. Jaffa, a behavior and management psychologist, recommends asking during the interview process if you can speak with current employees who would be on your team — or even chatting up employees you bump into outside the interview — to get a feel for the work environment.Some covid-19 rule-breakers could be narcissists, experts say. Here’s how to approach them.As for what to tell interviewers, you probably know to avoid speaking ill of former employers, but if they crossed any ethical or legal lines, “that’s fair game to bring up in an interview,” Weinstein says.When giving references, Jaffa recommends telling interviewers: “I’ll be glad to give you my former boss as a reference, but I’d also like to give you the names of two people who are more familiar with my work product.”Story continues below  Finally, tune in to the voice of your own experience, both as your own boss and as a veteran of abusive workplaces. Do some research on narcissism in general and on your own experiences, possibly with the help of a professional therapist, so you can recognize why a prospective boss’s behavior seems familiar for unpleasant reasons. And know your worth; when you’re secure in your own knowledge and talents, you’ll be better able to see through a charismatic abuser’s smokescreen.Pro Tip: For reading about how to deal with narcissists, Weinstein recommends “Disarming the Narcissist: Surviving and Thriving with the Self-Absorbed,” by Wendy Behary."

How do I push back and make sure he is aware that he can no longer assign me work, set deadlines or speak on my behalf?Work Advice: I'm a manager, but to my boss and colleagues, I'm a 'girl'Karla: What if I told you he is fully aware he is no longer authorized to do those things — but he’s trying it anyway?Yes, transitions are difficult, and old reflexes die hard. But it sounds like enough time has passed since your promotion that his attempts to dominate your meetings or oversee your work are more than forgetful mistakes. Each act he gets away with confirms that the old reporting structure is still intact for all practical purposes. And that undermines both you and your (his) boss. The response needs to be less “push back” and more “shut it down.”Story continues below  It’s possible you’re contributing to the problem by reflexively deferring to him, even unconsciously. If so, you need to retrain your brain to stop seeing him as Former Boss and start thinking of him as a peer from another department who is overstepping his boundaries. So how would you deal with that?Six ways your office will be different in 2021, assuming you ever go back to itFirst, ask your actual boss to help you develop a coordinated response strategy. “I know you said you would be talking to Pushy McBritches about the new reporting structure, but he is still trying to assign me work and has been hijacking my meetings with clients and management. My plan is to tell him to direct all requests through you, but is there another approach you would prefer I take?”AdvertisementShe might authorize you to deal with him yourself while keeping her informed. Or, since he can’t seem to relate to you as anything but his subordinate, she might prefer to step in herself to deflect his requests and intrusions, up to and including pulling him out of your meetings.Story continues below  Either way, the message remains consistent: You take your orders from her, not from him. Eventually he should take the hint. If not, the boss will just have to spell it out for him in a performance improvement plan or on a pink slip.Of course, if the message still isn’t getting through, there may be a bigger issue at play, either with your boss struggling to assert her authority or your insubordinate peer failing to recognize it.In that case, it’s even more important that you continue redirecting and deferring to your boss to reinforce — to Pushy, to everyone else, and most of all to her — that she’s in charge and you have her back. And if by chance any part of you is holding you back from taking the reins of your new position, you might give that part a stern but loving talking-to as well, with a similar message: I’m in charge, and you need to have my back."

Forbes warned that any of its contributors hiring Trump White House press officials will be viewed as a “potential funnel of disinformation.”Of course, the attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters was orders of magnitude more violent than the Charlottesville incident, as well as an outright assault on democracy. But aside from the historic enormity, another factor in the swift and decisive condemnation from all quarters may be that over the last few years, increased awareness of incidents of racism, misogyny, xenophobia and other forms of bigotry, recorded and shared on social media, have put pressure on businesses to consider what side of history they want to be on. And many have decided, to quote President-elect Joe Biden, that “enough is enough is enough.”Months later, more than 1 million Americans are still waiting for unemployment aid“Employers have had the opportunity to step back and think, ‘How can we create an inclusive … and bias-free environment?’ ” and to emphasize their values to employees and the public, says Marta Moakley, legal editor of XpertHR.com. This includes being mindful of the implicit messages conveyed in words, images and affiliations. Employers that have done that work will not want to see it undone by footage of off-duty employees spewing racist epithets or wearing anti-Semitic sweatshirts — certainly not while wearing employer-branded gear or ID tags.   Moakley notes that more than half of U.S. states have laws that prohibit companies from firing employees for engaging in legal off-duty conduct, from smoking and drinking to political activity.But beyond those specific state laws, you can still be fired from your private-sector job for engaging in protected free speech off the clock, if your employer determines it violates workplace culture.Just ask Juli Briskman, the Virginia woman who lost her contracting job in 2017 after exercising her First Amendment rights in the form of a middle finger extended at President Trump’s motorcade. (Two years later, she ran for election as Loudoun County supervisor and won.)Story continues below  It’s also a matter of workplace safety. Employers can’t afford to ignore someone they think is “contributing to an unsafe work environment, whether they’ve not had enough forklift training, or showed up to the workplace drunk, or may have contracted or been exposed to a virus and not taken proper quarantine precautions,” says Moakley.AdvertisementAnd they have to consider colleagues who may no longer feel safe in the workplace. “As a Capitol Hill staffer, it feels insane that we’ll be going back to work with the same people who incited and in some cases may have helped organize a deadly fascist attack on us,” Daniel Gleick, communications director for U.S. Rep.

What am I supposed to do with that?”Wait, isn’t this supposed to be an advice column?Story continues below  Fair enough. Let’s switch perspectives. What if you get fired for off-duty behavior — nothing illegal, but being in the wrong place/cohort at the wrong time? Or what if you’re worried, as some White House staffers reportedly are, about carrying the stigma of having worked for a widely reviled employer?If you have more chutzpah than regrets, you could follow the lead of the unnamed staffer who was quoted in Politico as saying he hopes to cite his steady service at the White House during the Capitol Hill siege as evidence that he is “an employee who can continue to produce and continue to have a good attitude in the toughest, highest-stakes and highest-pressure situations.” No doubt some employers will be impressed by that masterful spin.AdvertisementOr you can admit to your regrets and describe your consequent efforts to revisit your values and contributions to society.

(This question excluded activities such as insurrection, assault and incitement of such.)

After a brief discussion, Winston and his friends joined an “angry but peaceful” group of protesters, mostly Black residents, marching downtown. “I certainly don’t think my employer would have loved my getting arrested or charged,” said Winston. However, he acknowledges that he had the privilege of knowing that “as a White man … my likelihood of being arrested was low, and that I worked for a company that would probably support my decision to legally protest.”I asked Winston, whose prior jobs included news reporting and editing, how he would have acted differently if he had still been in news at the time. “I think I would have thought about it a little longer, and I wouldn’t have participated as much as observed,” he replied.Most  journalists are discouraged from taking part in off-the-clock activities that could call their objectivity into question. Former Washington Post executive editor Leonard Downie Jr. made a point of abstaining from voting during his tenure and strictly enforced The Post’s policy of discouraging news staff from active involvement in politics, demonstrations or other partisan causes that could compromise their work.   But some journalists chafe at professional restrictions against speaking their private mind in public, especially in these times of intense political rhetoric when silence feels like compliance with positions that pose harm to individual rights.Work Advice: What federal employees volunteering on election campaigns need to know about the Hatch ActLinda Lowen, former co-producer and writer for the weekly program “Take Care” on NPR affiliate WRVO Public Radio, is familiar with this paycheck-vs.-principles predicament. In early 2017, she joined an airport protest of the Trump administration’s Muslim travel ban and got in trouble with her higher-ups after a news crew captured footage of her attending the event. She considered quitting, but didn’t want to leave her co-producer and other show staff members in the lurch. She agreed to end her outside activism to keep the show going.“I regret it, I regret it, I regret it,” she says now of her decision to stifle her voice.   Lowen ended up quitting the show within a year for other reasons.

I’ve gotten used to wolfing down an apple at my desk before the event and eating dinner at home afterward. As a representative of the organization, I am seated at a table with guests, and I am far from the only vegetarian in attendance; one year, three others at my table were unable to eat the entree. But none of this has mattered to my director when we debrief after the event.

Starting with your last question first: If your dietary restrictions are tied to religious belief or medical issues, an employment lawyer can tell you whether it’s within your rights, and within reason, to bring this up as a legal matter. A simpler, less adversarial approach might be to ask the boss if you can expense a takeout meal to be eaten at your desk before the event, so you can keep your strength up for schmoozing.Story continues below  I can see your boss’s point that it’s not possible to anticipate and accommodate every faith-, fitness- or fad-based food restriction and unwise for a cash-strapped nonprofit to break the bank trying. Then again, when fast-food and takeaway restaurants at all price points are offering meatless options that go well beyond side salads, including footnotes listing common allergens, any decent caterer can do the same. And here’s the most persuasive argument why your boss should consider a broader course-correction: “Hangry” donors are less likely to be generous donors.AdvertisementThat brings me back to your first question.

That also means providing enough information to allow guests to decide for themselves whether it’s worth the effort to attend. “If you can’t stand the meat, stay home” is some cold hospitality, but it’s kinder than no warning at all.Office holiday parties are transformed for public health and economic crisesIf you have any part in arranging the events, try to send RSVP requests well in advance, including a preview of the menu and a space for comments and questions. If enough invitees decline with complaints about the lack of dietary accommodations, that might get your director’s attention — especially if you’ve already made a nonrefundable deposit.Story continues below  If you happen to have any personal connections on your board of directors, you might alert them discreetly to these concerns. They might be more sensitive to how skimpy hospitality affects guest morale, and they might have the clout to drive that point home with your boss.Incidentally, I wonder how many of your invitees might decline to attend just because, you know, there’s still a pandemic and they want to stay out of the plague pool. It might be worth doing a little research to see how other organizations have replaced in-person shindigs with virtual fundraisers or supporter-appreciation events, and be prepared to suggest some to your boss as an alternative."
71,"February 4, 2021","Reader: I am a therapist with a client who is looking for resources for navigating the virtual world. This client is distressed with all the changes in his work environment due to the coronavirus pandemic. He dislikes email, texting and the like because there are no cues. Further, he finds running meetings via video platform to be very challenging. He has expressed concern that he may be required to continue working from home permanently. I suspect he is not alone in his feelings and was hoping you could address this topic.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightKarla: Your client is absolutely not alone in his desire to get back to an office setting. According to a recent survey conducted by Future Forum, a consortium formed by workplace communication platform Slack, 20 percent of workers surveyed want to continue working remotely full time after the pandemic is no longer a safety concern — but an almost equal number, 17 percent, want to return to the office full time. Just because we’ve showed that being productive from home is doable doesn’t mean we all want to do it forever.Governors' shutdowns did not cause the pandemic jobs crisisStill, even if your client’s employer invites him back to the office, it will also probably accommodate those colleagues who prefer to continue working remotely. In the post-pandemic world, Future Forum VP Brian Elliott says, flexible policies and technology will be essential in “keeping a level playing field for people regardless of whether they’re at home or in the office.” All of which is to say that even if he’s at an office, your client will probably still be communicating with colleagues via email, text and video meetings much — if not most — of the time.   The good news is that the technology is only going to get better and more intuitive. It’s the interaction of the hardware and software with our personal wiring that gets tricky.Humans evolved to survive by communicating and responding to cues, down to minuscule shifts in tone and expression. Each stage of separation in communications — from in-person to video to phone to email to text — strips away more of those nuances and cues, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and conflict.Work Advice: Her face is holding her back, but not the way you thinkAvoiding miscues involves being transparent about your needs and boundaries and making a good-faith effort to understand and empathize with others’. Social bonds with your colleagues, in which you have a sense of each other off-the-clock, can smooth over a lot of those bumps, but the spontaneous water-cooler moments that help forge those bonds are hard to come by in an all-remote environment. That’s why remote-work-technology provider LogMeIn makes a point of scheduling virtual check-ins and polls employees on their “work-from-home persona,” according to Chief Human Resources Officer Jo Deal. “We talk about empathy a lot,” she says.   And here are tips I’ve picked up from years of failing at, thinking about and teaching business communication skills:· Always make sure you’re using the right medium for the people involved and the job at hand. Should this meeting be an email, or would in-the-moment interaction work better for this topic, with this person?· Familiarize yourself with conventions in different media. Briefly dropping eye contact is natural in person but can come across as evasive on video. Jumping into a message without at least a “Hi” is abrupt and rude in email, but less so in a text. You don’t have to adhere to all expectations, but it’s important to know and acknowledge when you’re breaking them.Story continues below  · Be aware of how artificial visual cues — punctuation, images, word choice — compensate for lost physical cues such as tone and facial expression. “Thanks.” “Thanks!” and “Thanks …” all land differently depending on the medium and the audience.Advertisement· Keep in mind that all messages are filtered through different brains in different emotional states with different histories. Assume neutral intent, and do your best to convey the same. If you know you come off rude in emails, have someone review your tone before you hit “send.” If you receive a rude email, pick up the phone and let the sender’s tone of voice tell you if you were misreading it.Work Advice: Manager with autism considers disclosing diagnosis to team· Most of all, know yourself, and help others know you. “It’s hard for me to keep up in texts. Can we talk this through live so I can ask questions?” “Do you mind if I keep my camera off so I can focus on what’s being said?” Speaking up about needs and preferences is encouraged at LogMeIn, says Deal, so workers can accommodate one another: “ ’This is how I work best.’ … Who’s going to say no to that? But if you don’t say it, they won’t know.”Pro tip: Missed cues also arise during in-person interactions for people who are neurodiverse or working in a different culture or language from the one they grew up with. So looking at workplace solutions that those groups have adopted might also help your client. Visit the websites Understood.org and Askjan.org for ideas."
72,"February 11, 2021","Reader: The one person with whom I never again wanted to cross paths was just hired at my workplace.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightA few years ago, “Wanda,” a former co-worker, asked me to put her up at my home for a couple of months until she could get a job. While living with me, she did not pay me much or do much. To make things worse, she had an accident while on my property and sued the company that owns the development. I asked Wanda to leave after two months. She finally left, but it was contentious.Work Advice: When researching an employee's questionable past, stick to the factsWanda eventually took a job somewhere else and shortly thereafter filed a short-term disability claim for a non-work-related accident. However, people witnessed her being very active while she was receiving benefits. She soon left that employer, and now she’s been hired by mine. You can’t work here if you cannot lift a certain amount of weight, so I think she may have omitted information about her injury to get hired.   I am a licensed professional and need to be able to trust my colleagues. Normally, I would give someone the benefit of the doubt, but I was burned by Wanda and am already stressed about her being here.Should I give HR a heads-up that Wanda and I have a past, just to get it on the record? If I try to discuss the past with her, I might get in trouble for harassment.Karla: It can be tempting to see a history like Wanda’s as an indictment of her integrity. But the only evidence I see of her burning you is when she took advantage of your generosity as your roommate/squatter. Even then, I could see her making a plausible case that you both understood the terms of your arrangement differently, or that she was desperate and contributed as much as she could.Story continues below  The other information you provide about Wanda could be interpreted to paint her as anything from a deliberate, habitual grifter to a hapless victim of a series of compounding setbacks who’s had to rely on the legal system and the kindness of others to try to get back on her feet.AdvertisementMore to the point, legal actions that didn’t directly involve you, secondhand observations about how “disabled” she truly was, and your suspicions about how she got this job are all hearsay and speculation. They may be accurate, or there may be a reasonable explanation for everything. In any case, going to HR or trying to confront Wanda directly with what you (think you) know about the past will almost certainly backfire.But you can use what you (think you) know about Wanda to set your own risk tolerance threshold for your interactions with her in the present.Story continues below  Aside from whether Wanda herself is trustworthy, you know you can’t leave room for misunderstanding or differing interpretation with her. That means double-checking information you receive at the source whenever possible. It also means following procedures by the book — in this case, your employer’s policy handbook.Video conferences are here to stay, even after we go back to the office. Get used to it.When you uncover inconsistencies, probe neutrally: “Wanda told me X, but Natasha, you’re saying Y. I need to know which is correct before I proceed.” It’s more work for you, of course, but the goal is to ensure your behavior is above reproach while giving Wanda space to prove —or impugn — herself.AdvertisementIf you detect a pattern of errors, falsehoods or policy violations in Wanda’s current work, or she’s literally letting others do all the lifting, that’s what you take to your boss or HR, ideally with documentation and witnesses to shield you against accusations that you’re pursuing a personal vendetta.Story continues below  Incidentally, if you hadn’t allowed Wanda under your roof, how much of her personal history would you even be aware of? For that matter, how well do you really know the other colleagues you place your trust in?As an example, many of us have learned to our dismay that what we consider “careful” behavior during the coronavirus pandemic exists on a broad spectrum of preventive measures and risk tolerance, and our family, friends, neighbors and colleagues may inhabit very different places on that spectrum. It’s enough to make you paranoid — or, at least, make you consider that no one, not even the people we choose to trust, is entirely above reproach."
73,"February 18, 2021","Reader: I recently joined a small team at a nonprofit. My supervisor is knowledgeable, hard-working, well connected, full of ideas and kind. Unfortunately, her documents are peppered with typos, and reading her emails is like solving a puzzle. As her program’s support person, I spend a lot of time deciphering and correcting her grammar mistakes. I don’t mind it, but I’m trying to come up with solutions to help her communicate more effectively. Our team is constantly buried in work, and fixing this one issue would make everyone’s life a little easier, especially hers.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI consider this an accessibility and equity issue. I believe in solutions and tools. She has a Grammarly account and regularly checks her work, which means that she is also aware of the issue and wants to correct it. I suggested getting a large monitor, as I suspect eyesight may be a factor, but it didn’t happen.As her subordinate, I’m unsure how to go about this. The fastest solutions would add considerable work to my plate and could also come off as insulting and hand-holding. When I brought my concerns to another staffer, I was scolded for being inconsiderate. I know I can be a bit of an overbearing busybody. Whether it’s a solution or a reality check, I’m open to any suggestions.Work Advice: How to help a co-worker whose language skills are less than ‘loverly’Karla: There is a time for helping people improve, and a time for meeting them where they are.   If your boss were explicitly asking for your guidance and coaching on better communication, you could send back marked-up versions of her messages for her to approve, so she can see what she’s doing wrong. But that may be the burdensome, insulting approach you’re trying to avoid. And it’s possible your boss has reached the point where struggling to refine her writing skills produces so little improvement that it’s not the best use of her paid time and energy.You might be right about this being an accessibility issue — but you might be trying to accommodate the wrong disability. If your boss has a processing condition such as dyslexia or dysgraphia, a larger monitor probably won’t help. Speech-to-text applications, as suggested by the Job Accommodation Network (askjan.org) and Understood.org, might help your boss dictate her thoughts more clearly, but even those results need proofreading.But — hear me out — what if the most efficient accommodation for your boss is a human interpreter with a talent for distilling ideas into clear, concise messages?   You say you “don’t mind” correcting grammar and typos. Perhaps it comes easily to you, so you underestimate its importance and how challenging it is for others. But doing it makes your boss look good and helps her get her messages out — so maybe, instead of a nuisance task, you should start viewing it as an essential part of your support role.Of course, even if your boss realizes writing isn’t her strong suit, offering to compensate for that weakness takes some diplomacy. One approach: Get in the habit of taking notes during all discussions and meetings. When she mentions needing to contact someone on a topic, offer to save her time by typing up your notes and sending them along for her review.Work Advice: Having words with a bad editor, and becoming a better writerI understand if you’re not interested in becoming the office Babel fish, especially if you have your own ideas to promote. And your boss may insist on continuing to craft her own messages as a point of pride. But then again, she might be relieved at being able to hand off a chore, and if she comes to rely on your messaging skills, she might be willing to find ways to relieve you of some of your other tasks.Allow me to riff on the client service credo: “Fast, cheap, good. Pick two.” In this case, the three options are smart, kind and well written. With your boss, you’re getting the first two. As someone whose day job revolves around helping people communicate clearly and correctly, I can tell you there are much worse bosses to have than smart, kind people whose grammar needs polishing."

The job I’m leaving is remote too, so I’m not worried about the work. I’m more concerned about the social and relationship-building aspect of changing jobs. I am curious what I can do to integrate myself at my new workplace when the normal ways of meeting and getting to know co-workers — in-person gatherings, lunches, coffee breaks, passing in the halls, etc. — are not available. I am a little shy and do not see myself as a great networker, even under non-pandemic circumstances.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightRight now, my plan is mostly to reach out directly to people for quick social calls and video chats. Do you have ideas for other ways I can build these relationships while we are all working from home?   Karla: Ordinarily the idea of randomly buttonholing strangers for contrived social encounters strikes me as awkward and off-putting. But then again, up until about a year ago, so would the idea of spending half my day grinning blindly into a tiny webcam lens while a colleague’s cat gives me the Butt Hello.Just as being the new kid in town gives you the perfect cover for fumbling names and asking lots of questions, the pandemic has given us all the perfect excuse to not just embrace the awkwardness, but to bond over it.Work Advice: How to make the best impression as a networking newbie“If we level the playing field and know that everyone is struggling ... and ask people how they are actually doing … that immediately opens up the conversation to something more real,” says Susan McPherson, a communications specialist and author of “The Lost Art of Connecting: The Gather, Ask, Do Method for Building Meaningful Business Relationships,” which will be released next month.   In her 100 percent remote consulting firm, McPherson encourages new hires to make 10-minute appointments with five colleagues during their first week — and nudges current employees to make a point of welcoming the new people.Managers can also build community among their teams by adopting and encouraging the use of tools such as Donut, Slack’s answer to the virtual water cooler, and by involving everyone in planning office gatherings and events, which McPherson has done with her employees.Once you have those opportunities, McPherson says, the goal is to “try to learn one non-work-related fact about someone” and “be prepared to share one non-work-related fact about yourself.”Story continues below  McPherson notes that asking someone what their “go-to Netflix series” is or the last article they enjoyed can tell you volumes about their interests and personality without getting too personal.AdvertisementBut if your shyness prevails, or you’re entering a workplace that isn’t really in sync with the virtual vibe — too much work, too little time — you can still get to know colleagues the old-fashioned way.Build on current connections.

If your office uses any kind of internal social media platform, use it to monitor what’s happening around you. Connecting to colleagues on LinkedIn or another work-related external platform is a good idea — but keep your nonwork social media activities walled off for now, and remember the four c’s of making contact: Be sure you have consent, use the appropriate channel, respect the context of your relationship, and make sure your cause justifies the contact.Work Advice: My son got fired for contacting a customer through LinkedInCultivate sources. There’s always someone in the office who knows the leverage points in any department, who can tell you the best people to contact — or avoid — when you need something done. Find and befriend that person. (But be wary if the ratio of personal gossip to productive intel seems too high.)And, as in real life, give it time.

Upon arriving for my interview with the director, I was surprised to see she was not wearing a mask.I asked if she would mind wearing a mask. She obliged, although her nose was exposed the entire time. She said since it’s a small office with only one other colleague, they don’t wear masks. Visitors are not required to wear masks, and a lot of people in the community refuse to wear them. She asked how I would manage the obstacle of my masking preference in this environment.We may not have to wear masks on planes forever. But should we?I explained that, based on my training and years of working with international clients, when an individual expresses a tolerance threshold, that  needs to become the standard for the group. I thought I was no longer in the running after that answer, but it seems they are still interested in bringing me onboard.   I am not comfortable working maskless indoors. I plan to ask if there is any chance of flexibility, such as letting me work remotely until I’m vaccinated. I’m not desperate for the job. However, it’s attractive to me as a career stepping stone. How do I handle their policy once I am hired?Karla: After the employer officially offers you the job, here is what you say: “Thank you for considering me, but I must decline this job out of safety concerns.”I originally had a more nuanced answer, with a series of if-thens and contingencies and diplomatic scripts for setting boundaries, but what I kept coming back to was this single-path logic chart terminating in a big flashing “nope”:Story continues below  You don’t need this job to get by.This employer will never have your back.One year into the coronavirus pandemic, there’s no such thing as eliminating risk of exposure in the United States. We improve our odds by wearing masks, washing hands, maintaining distance — not just for our safety, but ideally to avoid harming others. We hope others are equally conscientious. But we’re still just playing the odds against an often hostile house.Work Advice: My co-workers won't wear face masks and it's stressing me outThis employer has already showed you its hand. Aside from a half-[hearted] attempt to humor you during the interview, it’s clear that once you’re onboard, your colleagues will not do more than the bare minimum — and probably less. And if a conflict arises with an unmasked visitor, whose side do you think your employer will take? (Ask the former Trader Joe’s employee who claims he was fired for petitioning the CEO to let stores enforce mask mandates for customers.)AdvertisementWhat I’m saying is, you’ll be battling stiff odds every day in this job. The best-case potential payoff is a career boost; the worst-case potential loss, short of death, is lifelong debilitating health problems. To me, that looks like a sucker bet.Story continues below  Just as there’s no shame in taking a good-for-now job to keep yourself fed and sheltered, there’s no shame in prioritizing safety over career goals for now. This is a year for survival, not achievement.But I can’t know the pressures you face or how much this opportunity could mean to you. Maybe they’ll agree, in writing, to let you telework. Maybe your mask-averse little community will continue to defy the odds (until it doesn’t, like Perry County, Ill., which went from having fewer than 500 cases in the first seven months of the pandemic to  nearly 3,000 by the end of January).

In the weeks that followed, I contacted my interviewer to confirm the company had received my work samples and recommendations as requested. Again, I received much praise and interest.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI have initiated contact two more times. Apologies were made, with the delay attributed to the election, the holidays and the inauguration, but I was again strongly encouraged to continue to wait for corporate approval.Waiting for this position has me in a holding pattern and has kept me from moving forward. Is there a general time one should reasonably wait to be hired? How can I better navigate this situation?Story continues below  Karla: There isn’t really a one-size-fits-all length of time to wait for a job offer. The higher and better paying the position, and the more rarely it becomes available, the more deliberate employers tend to be about hiring, and the longer it may take for them to get approval.AdvertisementThat said, five months does seem like a long time, especially if you’re offering the kind of skills a media company could have used during an intense news-generating period.Millions of employees won't get a tax break for working from home during the pandemic. Companies with empty offices do.And then there’s the coronavirus pandemic, which has had devastating effects on employers across industries. According to staffing firm Robert Half, about a third of senior managers say they’re taking longer to make hiring decisions than they did pre-pandemic. Many are stringing candidates along and drawing out the hiring process as long as possible before making a decision, a practice known as “breadcrumbing.”Story continues below  The concept of breadcrumbing is most commonly used in online dating, but it applies in employment situations as well. The motive for breadcrumbing in an employment context is usually more business-driven than personal, of course, but that doesn’t leave job seekers any less confused or insecure.AdvertisementSome of these delays are due to financial uncertainty, according to Josh Howarth, Robert Half’s Mid-Atlantic district president. Managers may not be able to count on having a budget for the positions they’re hoping to fill, so they pull in candidates while trying to line up funding to hire them.And some employers may just be biding their time and waiting for the perfect candidate while they keep runners-up on standby. With unemployment numbers high in many sectors, employers “see there’s a lot of options out there,” says Howarth, so they “feel like they’re in the driver’s seat.”Story continues below  That’s a risky gambit, though. Not all markets are tilted in the employer’s favor; employers in some cities, such as Washington, are hiring just as quickly now as they were before the pandemic. And Robert Half estimates 62 percent of job candidates will lose interest in a job if they don’t hear back from the employer within two weeks after the initial interview. In other words, rather than stick around for crumbs, that bird-in-hand may fly off to beat the bushes elsewhere.The business winners in Biden's covid relief packageAs for you, Reader, it’s encouraging that your prospective employer is responding to your queries, although it would be a better sign if they were the ones taking the initiative to stay in touch with you. Is your would-be employer scrambling to secure funding and approvals behind the scenes, or just not that into you? Neither of those possibilities makes this sound like a stable or rewarding place to work. But what other choices do you have?AdvertisementThat’s not a rhetorical question. Are you investigating other openings and touching base with people in your network to let them know you’re open to something new? Or are you putting off other opportunities because you’re holding out hope that this one will come through, and you want to prove your dedication?Story continues below  A dream job may be worth keeping the flame of hope alive, but a few additional irons in the fire can provide some extra leverage. Having multiple offers in hand makes it clear you’re in demand, which could encourage a crumb-casting employer to pick up the pace — and maybe even cough up some real bread. More important, exploring multiple options will keep you from being blinded to new, potentially more fulfilling alternatives.In any case, Murphy’s Law and my inbox suggest that the “dream job” will come knocking as soon as you’ve secured something else. So if you do receive another offer, be sure to let the original hiring manager know you’re considering it — partly as a courtesy, but mostly to help you forestall any regrets before you commit to the new path."

However, it seems I’m expected to act interested in getting promoted.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIn my organization, many staffers eventually move into project-management roles. I am really not interested in that. I feel I have more job security where I am.How do I reconcile this at review time? I feel like a broken record saying I want to learn new tools and programs to stay current. My supervisor gave me a speech along the lines of “goldfish only grow as big as their bowl, so we want to make sure you are in a bowl you haven’t outgrown.”Work Advice: Young, scrappy, and hungry ... for promotionKarla: It sounds like your boss is trying to be encouraging with the goldfish analogy: Don’t limit yourself or let your environment grow stagnant.   But there’s also an undercurrent of warning here: As your salary increases over time, but your duties and skills remain unchanged, you risk growing to a size that your role can no longer sustain. When the company is looking to cut costs, or the executives you support move on, there may not be a suitable role  for you.Maybe you can enlarge your current role by mentoring and training new staffers, or by becoming a liaison to other departments.It might also help to play pretend a bit. What if you were interested in moving up? What are your unique strengths and most valued contributions? What other opportunities exist to use them? These questions are good prompts for coffee chats with your bosses and former staffers who have moved on. Even if you’re content to just keep swimming where you are, it never hurts to get outside perspective. And in your case, it’s not a bad idea for your bosses to see you exploring other waters.Work Advice: I was passed over for promotion. Is it disloyal to look for other jobs?  I am struggling to get a senior manager, a direct supervisor of six people and one of the best-paid people in my small organization, to act in a role appropriate to his position. When I first hired him, he was effective at streamlining operations and implementing necessary policies. Now he rarely takes initiative or suggests solutions, instead working on problems that should be delegated to others. I need him to focus on bigger-picture strategic issues, such as rethinking our approach to professional development.   I believe he loves the minutiae and doesn’t want to take on new challenges so close to retirement. I also think the coronavirus pandemic has been hard on him. He’s the kind of guy who needs to be at the office.His last performance review was awkward, as he had a point-by-point rebuttal for all my constructive feedback. If he were not so close to retirement, I’d think about bringing in someone new. Any thoughts?Karla: So, to borrow from the previous letter, he’s a huge goldfish with a large tank, but he’s trying to hide in the little castle.Many people (yours truly, for example) find comfort and purpose in anchoring themselves to specific tasks with clearly defined objectives — especially when feeling unmoored and overwhelmed by pending life changes, pandemic isolation or plain old burnout. But when the boss asks you to start doing the work you’re paid to do, “I don’t wanna” is simply not acceptable if you want to keep your status and income level.   You might nudge him back into strategic problem-solving mode by asking him to solve the problem he’s currently creating: “I need someone who can come up with a new professional development system. You’ve done this kind of thing before, and I believe you’re the best person for the task. But you seem to be balking at the idea. How do you suggest we get this accomplished?”If he shrugs and indicates it’s not his problem to solve, maybe point out that placing the choice in your hands means he might not like the outcome. (Before you do, check with HR to make sure you’re not acting in a way that suggests age discrimination.)If he’s not against the idea, but having a temporary crisis of confidence, you may be able to get him on track with just a little hand-holding. Discuss with him how to break the large, nebulous assignment of “rethink our approach to professional development” into a series of smaller, specific tasks, such as identifying flaws in the current system, interviewing vendors, researching other companies’ solutions — and assigning those tasks to people suited for them. Once he has people bringing him answers to those individual challenges, he may feel better equipped to assemble them into a larger strategic solution."

But spending priorities have changed during the epidemic, and employers tend to want to offer perks that benefit them as well as employees. Even if the funds are available, your employer probably doesn’t see much incentive in continuing to subsidize a commute you no longer have.AdvertisementBut you’re not alone in feeling the sting of lost benefits. In their efforts to stay afloat through the coronavirus pandemic, many employers have been cutting back on matching retirement plan contributions, bonuses, and other employee expenses deemed nonessential to their operations in the short term.Companies are scaling back layoffs because of Biden’s stimulus packageMeanwhile, some employers have increased spending on benefits that specifically address employee needs created by the pandemic, such as increased wellness and family care support, hazard pay and even incentives for getting vaccinated.Story continues below  So although it seems unlikely you’ll be able to persuade your employer to reinstate the transit perk for your personal benefit, you might be able to make a case for other ways your employer can compensate for its loss — especially if, like many, you have incurred additional expenses in working from home.AdvertisementIn a recent study, Harvard Business School researchers found a significant increase in housing costs — what they call the “remote premium” — for employees shifting to an all-remote work environment. Naturally, that premium falls heaviest on those who can least afford it; the researchers estimated that the lowest-income households would need as much as an additional 10 percent to 15 percent added to their earnings to compensate for those increased housing costs. In another study of energy consumption trends in the early months of the pandemic, a Tufts University researcher found that while industrial and commercial electricity consumption dropped 12 percent to 14 percent, residential electrical consumption rose by 10 percent. Employers that are saving money on commercial rental and utilities by converting to an all-remote workforce might consider passing those savings to employees to help offset their increased residential housing and utilities costs.Query for readers: What perks has your employer cut or added as a result of the pandemic?

My job immersed me in subject matter that I found fascinating and had gone to college and graduate school for.

79,"April 8, 2021","As spring weather and increasing availability of coronavirus vaccinations brighten the horizon, many employers are starting to make plans to bring employees back to the office, at least part time. It’s less a return to normal than an evolution to a new idea of what normal looks like — including rethinking what kinds of perks, benefits and incentives will keep workers engaged and offer employers a competitive advantage in the next era of employment.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIn-office meals and game rooms will hold less appeal for those who prefer working from home. Home-office stipends may not entice those who miss the hum and camaraderie of a busy office full of other adults. And employers aren’t going to want to throw away more money on benefits that made sense only when long commutes and face time were the default, however popular those benefits may still be.The hybrid office is here to stay. The shift could be more disruptive than the move to all-remote work.Take, for example, the employer mentioned in a previous column that stopped offering employees a public transit subsidy after shifting to an all-remote model during the pandemic. “Companies tend to be tougher when it’s a subsidy because it’s their money,” says David Judd, a transportation consultant in Watchung, N.J. The employer might also have been concerned about adhering to IRS rules on ensuring that tax-free commuter benefits are being used for appropriate business purposes.   But the employer in this case will probably have to replace that benefit with an alternative transit perk. Judd noted that New York is one of several U.S. cities where employers are required by local ordinance to offer some kind of pretax commuter benefit to employees. The employer, said Judd, could comply with the New York ordinance by letting employees fund their own transit benefits with pretax payroll deductions, keeping the employer’s costs down while giving employees a break on their work expenses.Looking ahead, even though transit perks may not be much in demand now, Judd notes that reinstating or enhancing existing transit perks would be a “great incentive to get people to come back to the office.""Six ways your office will be different in 2021, assuming you ever go back to itSpeaking of perks and incentives, other readers weighed in on how their employers have adapted their offerings to meet changing needs during the pandemic:   Last year, everyone in my division was sent home to work 100 percent remote. About eight months into the pandemic, my employer gave everyone $400 to spend on home-office things to help them work more effectively. A lot of people got ergonomic chairs or second monitors. It was a needed benefit and helped morale. — Zeez1026Perks my employer added because of the pandemic:1. Monthly mental health days (whole company closes for the day)2. $200 for additional expenses needed for a remote officeNo benefits were taken away. I’m sure they stopped the free snacks in the office, but no one is allowed in to the office to work. — Janice G., Arlington, Va.Story continues below  None of my employee benefits have been cut or reduced because of the pandemic, per my union contract. My employer-subsidized Metro card still works for the one day a week I go to my physical office. New benefits negotiated by my union include four hours of paid leave per shot to get vaccinated and a clear policy that paid sick leave can be used liberally for covid-related matters. Management also made it easier to file expense reports for office supplies purchased while working remotely. — Kurt Vorndran, Washington, D.C.AdvertisementI work from home designing scenery for a network television show that resumed production in August. Under union contract, the employer is obligated to pay the negotiated minimum rate plus health and retirement benefits. Every new show or season, we also have to negotiate “kit rental,"" a weekly payment to cover the costs of purchasing and maintaining things like survey equipment, printers, a laptop and software.This season, working from home, nothing was taken away, although we obviously aren’t provided breakfast and lunch as we were in the office. They would not pay any “home premium” compensation for increased electrical use, faster Internet or home-office setup.Story continues below  For my kit rental, I also negotiated a fee of $3 per day for the business use of my cellphone, adding $15 to my union-negotiated weekly rate. So in total, I lost lunch five days a week and gained $15. Thank God for my union agreement. — Carl Baldasso, New York City.Advertisement(I know there’s no such thing as a truly “free” lunch, but that’s one perk I would hate to give up. — Karla)Pro tip: With a pretax transit benefit account, as with any flex spending account, be careful to set aside only what you expect to use, and suspend automatic deposits when you don’t expect to need them for a month or more. The New York Times recently reported that employees who were laid off or are no longer commuting because of the pandemic are dismayed to find they can’t reclaim funds already deposited in their benefit accounts."
80,"April 15, 2021","Reader: From late 2020 into early 2021, I took a leave of absence from work to address my mental health challenges during the coronavirus pandemic. I had been in a very visible leadership role with lots of early-morning meetings (starting at 4 or 5 a.m.), and it wreaked havoc on my mental health. It definitely wasn’t my strongest year.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI received short-term disability pay throughout and was fully covered by federal and state medical leave laws.As I was phasing back into work over several weeks, it became clear that my job had been taken over by my boss and that the team was working well together. (There had been not good team dynamics among the people reporting to me when I left.)Story continues below  A few weeks after, I got my review. It wasn’t good, but I pushed back and my VP went to bat for me, so it was improved to a “strong” rating.AdvertisementUltimately my old role was eliminated and a new role was created for me, same salary but with a lower bonus structure. It’s something I could easily do and is probably the right place for me now. My time off helped me realize my meaning is more than title and salary; however, I’m not certain this was legal. Doesn’t FMLA require that you be returned to an equivalent role if your role is erased?Work Advice: Wanted: Servers who can lift 100 pounds. Work life in the coronavirus economy is changing.Karla: Yes, the Family and Medical Leave Act requires that you be returned to the same or an equivalent role when you return from leave. And Labor Department rules define an equivalent new role as “virtually identical” to the old one, not only in terms of pay and benefits, but also including the same skill set, status, privileges, and responsibilities, says Amy Epstein Gluck, employment law partner at FisherBroyles.Story continues below  Of course, some of those components, like “status,” can be hard to quantify. It might be worth consulting an employment attorney to analyze your old and new roles for an apples-to-apples view of whether you’ve really been given an “equivalent position,” or a stealth demotion.AdvertisementYou breezed by some details in your account that suggest the latter: There were “not good team dynamics” among the people you supervised, but they’re now performing better under different leadership; you had to fight for a better rating on what you acknowledge “wasn’t [your] strongest year.” If your originally weak performance review was based on problems that predated your leave, the company had better have “contemporaneous documentation” of those issues, Epstein Gluck warns, to avoid suggesting that you’re being punished or retaliated against for taking leave.And given that your old role “wreaked havoc on [your] mental health” and apparently contributed to your need for leave in the first place, it’s worth considering how to structure your new role so that it doesn’t undo your recovery. It’s possible you weren’t quite right for the old role — and certain that it wasn’t good for you — but that doesn’t mean you must meekly accept less than you’re entitled to. Even if your employer thought less visibility and a less challenging position would mean less strain on your mental health, that’s not the employer’s unilateral call to make.Work Advice: Making labor demands after a new mom's demanding laborSo how to ensure you’re being restored to the position you’re legally entitled to, but without the parts that made it untenable? “This whole thing is going to hinge on communication,” says Epstein Gluck. If, after talking with a lawyer, you’re concerned that you’ve been stripped of key features that make this job truly equivalent to your old position, it’s time to start a dialogue with management. And I hope you’ll either begin or continue working with a mental health professional to figure out what brings you genuine, self-affirming satisfaction at work beyond shiny markers of success.   In a way, your situation is a microcosm of what the pandemic has forced us all to realize about work, education and socializing: that our old way of doing things was not necessarily the most productive or healthy, and that alternatives are possible and desirable. We all need time and space to sort out what kind of world we want to return to and how it will differ from the one we knew pre-disruption."
81,"April 22, 2021","Reader: I am a software engineer and have been a U.S. resident for 14 years along with my wife and two teenagers. In spring 2020, my father in India passed away. On account of coronavirus-pandemic conditions and my asthma, I wasn’t able to travel to India to be with my mother. Because of this, it has been very difficult for me to focus on work, and my productivity has been heavily impacted. I currently work on a visa; my family cannot stay in this country without my job, and it’s difficult for me to change employers, although I’m trying to change groups within my company.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI have been on anxiety medications, and I have been receiving therapy and job coaching, as well. Despite all this, I’m facing pervasive burnout and desperately need a break from work. However, I am trying to save my leave for an eventual trip to India, and I don’t want to upset my manager by taking too many breaks. I have tried to be transparent with my manager about my condition and my plans, but I am not getting the support I would have expected.Can you please advise me on actions I can take to better handle these conditions?‘Pandemic grief’ proves especially devastating and complex for many in mourning, health experts sayKarla: One of the cruelest legacies of the coronavirus pandemic is that it has physically cut us off from loved ones when we most need to seek and share comfort with them. An added cruelty is that we’re expected to continue functioning and paying bills as though nothing were wrong.   In your case — and I’m speculating here, so feel free to disregard if I’m off base — add the background noise of being a noncitizen of South Asian descent in a country where xenophobic, white supremacist rhetoric and violence are at a fever pitch. Not to mention the constant threat of being expelled from this country as soon as you stop generating profits for your employer.That is a horrifying amount of grief, stress and fear to be carrying even without the threat of covid-19. No wonder you can’t focus.Work Advice: Office bereavement policies can avoid awkwardnessWhen you’re buried in conflicting emotions, stressors and fears, all you can do is triage what you can and can’t control. Another position with a more understanding boss would be great — but that option is largely outside your control, and your focus would still be hampered by covid stress, plus having to learn a new job.   Your current job is the one thing you have some degree of influence over. And, after your health, it’s also the thing you can least afford to lose.First, accept the unfortunate reality that you cannot expect more support from your boss, and set aside further mention of nonwork matters. (Exception: If you’re establishing the need for a legally protected accommodation or benefit such as job-protected medical leave, then you may need to speak up explicitly about your mental health and provide documentation from your doctor. An employment lawyer can advise you on when that may be necessary.)Next you must find a way to compartmentalize and focus your limited energies on doing the tasks your boss cares most about — stuff that keeps you from getting fired. If you’re working from home, you may have to find ways to artificially flip your mental switch to work mode — taking a walk before settling at your desk, or putting on an ironed button-down shirt, or breaking your day into 45-minute “sprints” of work. Your coach may have more suggestions.How to grieve during a pandemicOutside of work, here are some tips I have heard and used to stave off despair:   - Use some of the leave you’re saving. International travel — particularly to India, which is undergoing another devastating wave of coronavirus infections — is not going to be possible for some time. Figure out when you can afford to take days off — between projects, during a slow period — clear it with your boss, and fully disconnect from work.- Know that even though your pain is uniquely yours, you’re not alone in suffering. Acknowledging another person’s burden, or expressing gratitude to someone who has supported you, reinforces the bonds that keep us all afloat. A grief support group or a cohort of peers in your situation can be a good raft.- Trust that it won’t be like this forever. If there’s any comfort to be had, it’s in knowing that things will change."
82,"April 29, 2021","Reader: I took early retirement last year. Shortly thereafter, I decided I wasn’t quite ready to stop working. With the coronavirus pandemic in full swing, I went back to school to become a paralegal. This worked out perfectly, as I am disabled and use either a walker or a cane, and the virtual classes were easy to attend.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI am starting to apply for paralegal positions. Due to the continuing pandemic, the work is listed as remote, and the interviews are virtual as well. At what point in the process do I let a prospective employer know I am disabled? I don’t want this to hinder any opportunities, but I also don’t want to surprise them with this information and make it appear as though I was hiding something. What’s the best way to disclose a disability in this virtual job-hunting environment?   Karla: If a prospective employer thinks your skills are a fit for the job, and your disability doesn’t interfere with your performance — which it shouldn’t do, if the remote job is anything like your virtual classes — then it shouldn’t matter when you disclose. (Not to mention that the Americans With Disabilities Act prohibits most employers from discriminating against candidates solely on the basis of a disability.) But I respect your concern about springing an unexpected challenge on a potential employer.Work Advice: The delicate issue of disclosing a disability during the application processInstead of thinking of it as “disclosing” anything, approach it in the spirit of performing due diligence on whether this job and this workplace are a good fit for you, because you’re confident you’d be a great hire.During the interview or while you’re considering an offer, ask: Does the employer intend for the job to remain remote once the coronavirus exposure is no longer a concern? Is remaining remote an option? If not, then you will need to know how accessible the office is for people who use mobility aids — elevators, stairs, emergency evacuation plans.   As I’ve said before, if any good comes of the pandemic, it will be the confirmation of just how many office jobs can be performed from home as effectively as from a commercial office. Although some tasks legitimately require in-person interaction for legal or security reasons, it’s harder for employers to arbitrarily deny remote work options if they have a year’s worth of evidence that their workers can be just as productive from home.Work Advice: My co-workers are grumbling about my telework privilegesReader: A customer of our office has offered me a one-week stay, at no charge, at a vacation home during the summer. Our office staff all serve this customer, and I am no more helpful than the person next to me. The customer is thrilled to gift the week, but I feel so guilty that others don’t have the same opportunity. Do I take the offer or turn it down? I somehow think I would feel better turning it down. I literally couldn’t fall asleep last night thinking about it.Karla: Pros of accepting this generous offer: It would be a lot of fun.   Cons of accepting:It puts you in the customer’s debt, even if it’s not intended to. You provide service; the customer pays for the service. Balance achieved. By offering you a freebie vacation on top of that, your customer is tipping the scales out of balance and creating more obligation.Accepting the gift could create an unforeseen conflict of interest that puts your company in a bad position.If your co-workers find out, it will probably create resentment.Accepting a mysterious “free” vacation is how horror movie characters end up stranded in the woods fleeing a chainsaw-wielding maniac — or worse, listening to a timeshare pitch.If you have a long-established personal friendship with this customer outside of work, and the vacation was given in the context of that relationship, it might be a different matter. Otherwise, you should not accept gifts from a client that you cannot share with colleagues, with one exception: A customer who feels you have been particularly helpful can write a note to your boss saying as much."
83,"May 6, 2021","Timesaving disclaimer: This week’s piece is going to focus primarily on problems involving parents and opposite-sex couples. I’d also like to hear perspectives from child-free workers and same-sex couples at work.advice.wapo@gmail.com. — KarlaWpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightFor this Mother’s Day column, I’m going to turn some quantitative data into a question: Why aren’t there more mothers?Despite widespread wink-wink-nudge-nudge predictions that the pandemic lockdown would boost the declining birthrate, the anticipated baby boom has been a bust. But it’s not just the coronavirus having a contraceptive effect among those who might have considered starting or expanding their family. This is part of a downward trend.Story continues below  I’m no economist, but from conversations with fellow moms and child-free workers alike, I can guess some reasons. The combination of low wages and the high cost of living makes a baby look like a luxury item, while the growing gig economy cuts into the numbers of permanent full-time positions from which to make a decent living. The short- and long-term effects of childbearing on women’s health may be a deterrent, especially in the absence of reliable and accessible health care. And this past year brought into focus a problem that preceded the pandemic: For many women, becoming a mother means being put at a lifelong economic and career disadvantage.March saw promising gains for women. Is the 'she-cession' over?Women suffered major job losses this year — partly because majority-female industries were the hardest hit by the pandemic, but also because no human can sustain the dual full-time duties of caring for minor children and performing a full-time job. Even in dual-earner families where both parents were able to work from home, it was primarily moms who took the hit in paid hours to focus on children’s schooling and care. Plenty of articles covered this phenomenon, but nothing captured it for me quite like the New York Times photo of a mother on a work call helping her child go potty while, on the other side of the bathroom wall, the child’s father took his work call in a clean, quiet home office.AdvertisementGranted, that’s only a snapshot. But it’s not hard to imagine potential mothers looking at that photo, calculating how much time and energy their current jobs demand, perhaps taking stock of  the division of household labor in their homes after a year on lockdown, and thinking: “…nah.”Story continues below  Even with a solid partnership and a stable job, the median annual income in the United States is not quite enough to cover a year’s worth of expenses for a family of four with one income-earning parent. And in dual-earner families, pre-K child care can consume a bigger part of the monthly budget than housing — bad news when housing is already the biggest of many families’ expenses.And let’s look at moms’ choices. When women take time off to raise a family, their earning potential takes a hit. When they’re ready to relaunch their careers, their starting block has been moved back. And as many who opt out of the paid labor force have discovered, the “stay-at-home wife” gig doesn’t come with a guaranteed retirement package.AdvertisementWomen who work continuously through motherhood, even in “family-friendly” workplaces, may find their pay and promotion prospects lag behind those of male colleagues with children — the “motherhood penalty” and the “fatherhood bonus.”Story continues below  Don’t get me wrong: For many, motherhood is emotionally rewarding. But it’s economically punitive. How can we make it just as rewarding to be an income-earning mom as it is to be an income-earning dad?The Biden administration, under a child-care-as-infrastructure approach, has announced ambitious proposals to provide quality child care for all families, pay care providers a livable wage, and ease the cost burden for all parents. The plan is appealing but far from a sure thing.Societally, it’s been hard to dispel the idea that women are just “naturally better” than men at raising children and managing households. But women have overcome similar gatekeeping to break into such lucrative fields as STEM and business management that men were deemed “naturally better” at, and because that work is valued by society, breaking in was worth the effort. Men who want to be true partners in parenting and domestic life can — and many have — overcome the expectations and assumptions working against them, especially when society assigns more value to that work.Child-free worker resents having to pick up slack for working moms and dadsWorkplaces can support that change by making work as flexible and accommodating for dads as for moms, with equal paid parental leave for moms and dads and paid leave for anyone with care-taking duties. Besides being more egalitarian, that approach would help alleviate what a Harvard Business Review blog refers to as the “working dad’s career trap,” when the pressures of work leave high-earning fathers no room for focusing on outside priorities. Finally, acknowledging and eliminating hiring bias against older parents relaunching their careers would make parenthood less of an all-or-nothing proposition.   The pandemic isn’t entirely to blame for declining birthrates, but it has magnified  systemic problems that make motherhood in particular look like a bad deal. Some of the solutions we’ve been forced to adopt in response to the pandemic — subsidized care, paid leave, flexibility in hours and location — can not only equalize the burden on moms and dads, but also help model better work-life balance for everyone."
84,"May 13, 2021","For those of us lucky enough to have had a job that can be done from home throughout the pandemic, remote work offers certain freedoms that many of us are loath to give up after a year: freedom from the time, expense and effort of commuting and traveling; freedom from in-person interruptions and distractions (aside from cohabitants and dependents in our homes); and, in some cases, freedom from rigid business hours within which all tasks must be completed and all hands, busy or not, must be on deck.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThere’s another freedom that particular subsets of remote workers are experiencing: freedom from dealing with subtle, often unintended expressions of bias known as microaggressions. Individually, these incidents are seldom serious enough to merit HR confrontations. But experiencing them daily is like death by a thousand paper cuts, and processing internal reactions to them drains mental energy and satisfaction.Future Forum, a consortium formed by workplace communication platform Slack, said its surveys of remote employees suggest that most remote workers would prefer to keep at least some remote work as an option. Future Forum also said it found Black employees have a more pronounced preference for continued remote work than White employees.Analysis: It's not a 'labor shortage.' It's a great reassessment of work in AmericaAccording to Tina Gilbert, managing director of Management Leadership for Tomorrow, a partner organization of Future Forum, feedback from survey participants indicated that in addition to greater flexibility and balance, Black knowledge workers had a greater sense of belonging when they didn’t feel the constant need to “code-switch” to fit in with a majority-White office environment.   Workers from other demographics have also experienced fewer microaggressions while working remotely. “Doc Mimi,” a Hispanic American government employee and adjunct professor from Bel Air, Md., has frequently had to deal in real time with co-workers’ surprise when they learn she has a Hispanic maiden name along with her Ph.D. (“You don’t have that much of an accent!”) She was also often surrounded at the office by audible personal conversations that veered into racially and sexually inappropriate topics. Even whispered conversations “echoed through the walls,” she recalled.In a Twitter discussion on office microaggressions, people said working at home has largely spared them from having to deal with such incidents as:having colleagues touch their hairbeing mistaken for another colleague of the same race (a problem solved by having names displayed in video meetings)overhearing insensitive commentary on or being pressured to discuss traumatizing news events such as racist violence or coronavirus outbreaks in their home countryfielding comments from passersby on their “angry” (actually focused) expressionsWork Advice: Her face is holding her back--but not the way you thinkWorking remotely doesn’t prevent all forms of microaggressions, of course. But rather than having to “put a smile on your face and keep moving” in response, says Gilbert, workers at home can more easily connect with their personal support network, which lets them bounce back and regain focus faster. And it’s not just about comfort, it’s also about productivity and efficiency: Allowing people to work in an environment where they don’t feel the need to keep their guard up means “releasing that mental burden from people who are … getting paid to think,” Gilbert explains.   Employers whose remote workers are reluctant to return to the office would do well to seek feedback on the reasons. Are there workplace-specific stressors that workers didn’t consciously identify before, but now dread having to deal with again? Do employees have specific health or safety concerns that remote work can alleviate? For example, Doc Mimi’s health improved at home, away from colleagues wearing asthma-triggering scents. Workers with disabilities may have been spared the stress of navigating building access and transportation challenges.Work Advice: Telling a potential employer about a disability in a remote-work environmentAnd given the documented rise in anti-Asian violence over the past year, Asian workers who reasonably fear for their safety while commuting on public transit might feel safer if they continue working from home, or if they’re offered a safer transportation alternative.Anecdotes aren’t data, but it seems clear that even when the pandemic is no longer as much of a threat, unaddressed microaggressions may keep office spaces from feeling entirely safe or healthy for some workers. Employers that seek out and listen to feedback on ways to make their work environments more inclusive can ensure that when their remote workers are welcomed back into the office, they’ll actually feel welcome."

That reckoning is more likely to stick if it’s brought to him by a friend.Work Advice: A friend has a bad rep in his field. Do you tell him?There’s no way to “soften” the objective truth that, despite his allegedly best efforts, his work failed to meet quality standards and required significant time and effort to correct. Nobody enjoys hearing that. You can make clear that the criticism is not personal, and emphasize how difficult it is for you to critique a friend’s work — but you must also make clear that you agree with Alice on the poor quality of his contribution, so he can’t dismiss it as just a personal vendetta. And, worst case, if he’s malignant and tries to retaliate by complaining to his pals in the administration, it’s all the more important for you and Alice to present a united front.No, Dan might not thank you for your honesty.

A recent example was someone in another department holding up my biggest project, claiming a lack of information despite receiving regular updates from my team. When I expressed frustration in an email about this person’s inattention causing unnecessary delays, he replied, “Calm down.”Masks are off — which means men will start telling women to ‘Smile!’ againI’ve always had candid relationships with previous bosses (none of them straight White men), where we could share our thoughts and feelings.

Karla: I want to answer the question you’re asking, but I don’t think it will solve the problem you have. Let’s start with the parts I think we can agree on:Being told to “calm down” when you’re trying to communicate a legitimate problem is infuriating — and that makes it nearly impossible to respond in a way that doesn’t confirm for the other person that you are, in fact, in need of calming.Admonitions to “calm down” are seldom distributed equally or equitably.

Seniority, rank, race, gender and other factors play heavily into who gets characterized as “passionate,” “driven” or “a perfectionist,” versus who gets tagged as “angry,” “abrasive” or “hard to work with.” (Shout-out to my younger female colleague in a prior career who was counseled to be less “shrill” after raising her voice during a weekly meeting where an older male colleague regularly turned the air blue with profanities.)Some women mask up to deflect attention, but what we really want is freedomPeople at the lower end of the privilege scale, especially in service or care-taking jobs, are accustomed to absorbing, validating and filtering other people’s emotional spillover to identify and solve underlying problems. But someone like your boss probably lacks that experience in a professional context, so any degree of emotional context, however mild, overwhelms his ability to analyze the problem. He might characterize it as just being logic-driven — but how often have you seen Mr. Spock snap, “oh, calm down” at Dr. McCoy?It’s tricky to call out an ally for problematic behaviors, especially unconscious habits. Even if you’re careful to make clear that it’s the behavior you’re labeling as sexist, not the person, you’ll probably trigger some defensiveness.Having agreed to those points, I’m going to answer your question with more questions: How important is it for you to be able to vent your frustrations to your boss? Can you extract the emotional context and report just the distilled problem to him, and then vent your spleen separately with someone who can handle it?I trust that you’re not being dramatic or unprofessional, and this is not to say feelings have no place at work. Negative emotions alert us to problems and drive us to seek solutions. And sometimes the emotion is inextricable from the business problem, as when a colleague’s disrespect damages your rapport and thus your productivity. That’s why emotional intelligence is an increasingly sought-after trait in leaders.   Which brings me neatly back to your situation. If your boss’s maddeningly dismissive responses are preventing you from working effectively with him, here are some suggested approaches — all best delivered (in person, or by phone or live video) in as neutral a tone as you can manage.Humor: “You realize ‘calm down’ is the least calming thing you can say to anyone, right?”Concern: “I take our team’s on-time delivery seriously, and I know you do too. But this other department is not treating our schedule as a priority. How can we remedy that?”Straight talk: “When you tell me to calm down, it comes across as dismissing my concerns. I would like to be candid with you about problems affecting me and my team.”"
87,"June 10, 2021","Reader: A month or two before the coronavirus pandemic, my boss had his four grade-school-age daughters in the office. One of them, maybe 8 years old, was apparently acting up, but I didn’t see it. Her dad caught her while passing my desk. He grabbed both her arms and was shaking her, speaking in a low and intimidating voice in a language I don’t understand. I saw the shaking and the terror on the child’s face.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI read in another advice column about a husband who shook his wife, and the adviser called that abuse. If it is abuse when done to an adult, then it’s abuse when done to a child, right?I'm appalled at myself for saying and doing nothing. It has bothered me since it happened, and I often play out scenarios in my head on what I should have done. If I had stepped in, I would have had to look for another job. Maybe I need to look anyway. He's not pleasant to work for.   Once we are all back in the office, what could I do if the situation happens again? I’m sure it’s happened since. I’ve just not been a witness with us all working from home.Karla: Most parents struggling to balance work and child-care demands simultaneously in the past year have probably found themselves losing patience with their offspring more than usual, possibly within sight or earshot of colleagues on virtual meetings.[My boss is tired of me bringing my child to work]But this pre-pandemic incident with your boss and his daughter goes beyond raising his voice or giving her The Look. And if he treated his child that way in front of others on an ordinary day, who knows what he's been like at home during lockdown, with no outside witnesses.Story continues below  Some will dispute whether what you saw even constituted abuse, or argue that you shouldn’t judge people on how they discipline their children. For what it’s worth, my view is that laying angry hands on a child or partner — anything that would get you charged with assault if you did it to a stranger — is abuse, regardless of how any moral or secular laws define it.AdvertisementMany workplaces offer various forms of support for employees who are victims of domestic violence, but what about when an employee is a suspected abuser? Also, while most workplaces (should) have clear policies on what constitutes inappropriate behavior among employees, or between employees and clients, there’s no such handbook governing employees’ interactions with their family. Complaining to HR might put an end to such incidents in the office, but that won’t help the victim.So please forgive yourself for not knowing what to do in the moment. Now that you’ve processed what you’ve seen, please heed your gnawing conscience and contact the experts, such as the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at https://childhelphotline.org/ or call 800-4-A-CHILD.Story continues below  They can advise you better than I on how to intervene if you witness abuse in the future, including ways to divert and defuse without further endangering the child or yourself. They can also advise you on whether and how to report what you witnessed to the appropriate authorities or community resources.AdvertisementEven though your boss wields economic control over you, you still have more power than you realize. If nothing else, it can make all the difference to an abuse victim to receive a message from the outside saying, “That’s not okay, and you deserve better.”And yes, do start putting out feelers for jobs elsewhere — partly so fear of losing this job doesn’t stifle your compassionate impulses, and also because your boss, by your own account, is “not pleasant to work for.” Even if he knows he can’t get away with grabbing and shaking employees, he may be engaging in other abusive and bullying behaviors toward you that have damaging mental and emotional effects. That’s not okay, and you deserve better.Story continues below  In response to my recent column on remote workers enjoying a break from microaggressions at the office (May 16, 2021), here is an example of other forms of microaggressions (and in some cases, possibly overt discrimination):AdvertisementI am a White, Jewish woman in my late 50s who has been on the receiving end of numerous microaggressions related to religion/ethnicity and age. These incidents have come from White and Black colleagues and have included snide remarks; antisemitic slurs; repeated attempts at religious conversion; and persistent and unwelcome questions about my religion, ethnic symbols and foods, and religious practices. They have also included remarks that reference my status (e.g. referring to someone as a “little old lady”). Like all members of minority groups, I also “code-switch” at work. I avoid discussing religious holidays, foods, or practices and avoid in-group slang expressions or speech inflections. Microaggressions are hurtful and insulting to all who receive them.—Emily [Last name withheld], Washington, D.C.Back to the pre-pandemic grind: Are you heading back to the office after working remotely during the pandemic?

88,"June 17, 2021","My blazer and dress shoes felt like an old suit of armor in need of oiling. But my 8-year-old was impressed: “Fancy schmancy! You look like you have an important business that you’re late for.”WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightOn June 8, 2021, more than a year after my day-job employer temporarily closed its offices nationwide for the pandemic, I made my first return trip to our K Street office in Washington. Like most employers in the D.C. metro area with a remote workforce, mine isn’t planning to bring most employees back before fall, but the video production team that I work for wanted to make sure all the equipment that we had left at the office a year ago was in working order. After watching a brief video on new safety protocols and completing an online wellness check-in, I was cleared for return.Story continues below  Pre-pandemic, my standard commute averaged 90 minutes each way — two hours if the weather was bad or if I left the house after 7:30 a.m. That held true whether I joined the grille-to-tailpipe crawl along Interstate 66, or wedged myself nose-to-armpit with other Metrorail riders, or treated myself to a stiff-necked nap on a long-haul commuter bus. (Fortunately, even before the pandemic, I had flexible hours and the option of working from home when circumstances warranted.)AdvertisementBut this particular morning, I hit the road at 8 a.m. and made the 40-mile drive in 45 minutes. Wouldn’t it be nice, I mused, if it could always be like this, with most workers commuting only as needed, rather than to meet arbitrary employer expectations, minimizing congestion for everyone.Sheila Emond, a federal employee in Franklin, Mass., shares my view. Working remotely for 14 months saved her 90 minutes per day of commuting time, hundreds of dollars in gas money, and wear-and-tear on her car and herself. “The lack of stress … may have added a year to my life,” she says.The covid-era workplace: Hard questions, no easy answersDuring the pandemic, D.C.-area traffic dropped from fifth-worst in the nation to 12th, the steepest drop of any U.S. metro area. A New York Times article analyzing trends in rush-hour traffic over the past year suggests that flexible scheduling and telework policies could make life better not just for those working remotely, but for everyone else as well — by flattening the peaks of rush-hour congestion that city and transit planners have to design everything around.   As pleasantly surprised as I was by the easy commute, I was utterly unprepared for the surge of joy I felt at seeing the parking garage attendant’s familiar face. As we revived our old payment-for-ticket routine with newfound earnestness — “How are you? So good to see you again!”—it struck me how close we had come to losing that small personal ritual forever.Reentering the workplace felt at once familiar and foreign, imparting a sense of day-job vu. My colleague and I crept past empty cubicles and offices, feeling a bit like scavengers or archaeologists touring a post-apocalyptic civilization that was largely unchanged except for the hand-sanitizer stations and politely worded safety signs posted everywhere.As with visiting an old elementary school years after graduation, everything seemed smaller somehow. I realized I’d outgrown boundaries I never noticed before — for example, swearing audibly, a habit I’ve become overly comfortable indulging at home.   Other remote workers making their return are discovering that the workplace has become too tight a fit in other ways. Some tech companies that embraced fully remote work models at the start of the pandemic have announced plans to resume requiring regular in-office hours, leading to complaints from workers and, in some cases, departures for jobs with more flexibility and autonomy.Work Advice: Microaggressions at the office can make remote work even more appealingOf course, many workers received no commuting reprieve at all in the past year, even if their commute was less crowded.For many essential workers and service providers, not being at the workplace meant not having a job, and they had less control over their working hours and conditions than ever.Story continues below  After a year-plus of serving stressed-out customers and dealing with the constant threat of exposure to the coronavirus, increasing numbers of hourly workers are abruptly leaving their jobs for better opportunities. And health-care workers on the front lines of the pandemic have been burning out and dropping out at an alarming rate. For all the praise essential workers have received over the past year, precious little has been done to tangibly and permanently improve their working conditions and their ability to earn a secure, comfortable living.AdvertisementAlthough Emond, the federal worker, described her year of working from home as “some of the best months of my entire life,” she also expressed sorrow that “it took something so horrible to create such a positive change.” If there’s any lasting good to come from this global tragedy, it will mean remembering the ways we’ve adapted for the better, saying “what if it could always be this way,” and taking the steps to make that what-if a reality."
89,"June 24, 2021","  I just found out that a vice president at my company wants me fired, and even suggested doing so at a senior-level meeting. Even more worrisome, I learned the VP I report to did not stick up for me.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI was floored and devastated when I heard. I am a middle manager, well-respected among colleagues and clients, and my productivity is outstanding according to all my annual evaluations and numbers. I heard from reliable sources that what saved me was the fact that I am well-respected among colleagues and clients.More than two years ago, this VP came in and wanted to cut costs in my highly productive unit. I went over his head to the CEO to put a stop to it. I’ve been warned by others that he has had it out for me ever since, and it’s evident in some of his passive-aggressive actions toward me and my unit.   He has become really tight with the CEO. I can’t help feeling I’m one mistake away from being fired. Do you think the writing is on the wall for me, or am I overreacting?Retail workers are quitting at record rates for higher-paying work: 'My life isn't worth a dead-end job'Karla: Assuming your sources are reliable, the writing is indeed on the wall that this VP wants you gone — but that’s not the end of the story.I know what a gut-punch it is to learn that higher-ups are not impressed with your good work and want you out of the way. But the good news is that customers and colleagues value your work, and, based on the outcome when you went to bat for your department, the CEO is willing to listen to you, too.To me, the bigger gut-punch would be learning that the new VP was simply saying something out loud that everyone else was already thinking — but his beef with you seems to be purely personal.   An executive pursuing a petty vendetta against a lower-ranking professional in someone else’s department says more about him than about you. That’s not to say he can’t succeed in ousting you, but whatever excuse he claims, it won’t really be because of something you did wrong.As you say, the worrisome thing is that the person who should be your champion — your own VP — didn’t immediately shut down the suggestion to fire you. Maybe your VP is fearful, or nonconfrontational, or saw the comments as toothless and beneath notice.The first step is to let your own VP know some — not all — of what you’ve heard. “I understand New VP recently said he thought I should be fired. Is this something I should be concerned about? Is there a problem with my performance, or anything I can do to improve his impression of me?” Your VP’s response may tell you how much you should be worried, and if your VP has your back, your questions will be a wake-up call that ignoring your antagonist may cost the company a star performer.   In the meantime, keep this in mind: This VP somehow sees you as a threat that can only be dealt with through political machinations. Use that as fuel to keep being aggressively excellent and promoting your team’s successes, bringing your best for clients and colleagues. And start strengthening your connections with anyone in a position to provide solid references and leads if your antagonist prevails, or if you simply grow tired of working with a sword dangling above your head.  I’m a federal employee on detail to a small group. I love my job and want to stay until I retire in a few years.I have read about other older women’s legitimate complaints about their treatment at work. I had numerous grievances about my old workplace. But in my current job, except for one incident years ago, I’ve been treated with great respect. I was thinking of emailing the chief of staff to thank them for not being sexist and ageist — but should I thank them for doing what everyone should obviously do 24 hours a day?Work Advice: How do I respond to younger workers who make snarky comments about my age?Karla: Pardon the vulgarity, but “Thank you for not sucking” sets a rather low bar.   But it’s simple enough to flip the script and focus on what your boss is doing right: “Thank you for fostering an equitable workplace. I am grateful to be working in a supportive, uplifting environment where I feel respected and valued. I’m consistently inspired to give my best.” The “unlike other places I have worked” subtext is implied.If saying that directly feels a little kiss-uppy, you can always incorporate the message into feedback forms or performance evaluations. A positive endorsement on a site like Glassdoor would help a good employer stand out in a sea of complaints — as long as it doesn’t sound like something a PR firm was hired to write."
90,"July 8, 2021","Reader: I’m a director-level operations and HR leader at a small start-up. My boss, whom I have known for many years, is currently pulling triple duty as COO, CFO and general counsel. Thanks to his diligence over the past few years, we are finally making solid revenue with lean operating expenses, and we have started adding new hires.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI love my job and my co-workers overall, and I make decent money, but I hate interacting with my boss on certain financial matters.We have a small-items expense policy that allows employees to purchase certain low-cost items with fast reimbursement. Larger expenses are generally charged to our corporate card after an approval process. Over the past few years, my boss has repeatedly tried to have me expense larger purchases, recently as much as $1,500, using my own credit card — presumably to simplify bookkeeping.   I always push back, but the conversations leave me feeling humiliated. I’m a Black man with not the greatest credit score, living on a tight budget, and although my boss is an ally who tries to drive diversity and inclusion, it feels like a “White privilege” issue that he assumes I somehow have liquidity to cover these purchases.I’m also worried about how this affects new employees. Some senior employees are fine with charging an $800 purchase for reimbursement, but it could be a hell of a hit to a junior hire. And that’s not the culture I want to build for this team.We have performance reviews coming up, including upward feedback. I’m thinking it’s time to have a hard talk with my boss about this, and I’m terrified. This expensing issue is the one thing that has ever made me consider leaving this company.   Karla: “Come on, you know I don’t mix business expenses with personal ones.” Delivered firmly, with a smile, every time.Work Advice: Expense retorts: Workers question paying out of pocket for trade shows and bad coffeeEmployers should not be floating operating expenses on their employees’ backs, no matter how much those employees earn, or how they spend it. Your paycheck is not a slush fund for your employer to dip into to keep its books balanced.If a start-up’s founder chooses to take on a hefty business expense, that is one thing. But no employee should be asked or even subtly pressured to do the same for management’s convenience. What if reimbursement is delayed and the employee has to pay interest? What if the expense isn’t approved for reimbursement, or the company suffers a catastrophic (cough-pandemic-cough) setback?Story continues below  Fortunately, your company’s expansion plans offer the perfect opportunity to discuss tighter policy enforcement, for everyone’s protection: “Now that we’re ramping up hiring, I think we should firm up our expensing policy and small-items limit to make sure everyone’s going through the appropriate approval and documentation channels.”AdvertisementIf that policy is too restrictive and cumbersome, you might discuss broadening access to the company card to a wider group of managers — but always in conjunction with formal policies that ensure everyone is operating under the same rules.You don’t need to reveal your personal financial situation, but you can use it to help you express and inspire empathy for others in similar straits: “We need to ensure all our managers and employees have equal access to the equipment and resources they need to do their jobs. We don’t want anyone feeling pressured to spend their own money, or concerned they or their team will be at a disadvantage because they can’t afford big-ticket items outside the approval process.”Story continues below  Incidentally, if your boss is truly open to hearing upward feedback, it might be worth asking whether some of his planned hires should be at the executive level.AdvertisementStart-up leaders frequently wear multiple hats to stay nimble and avoid making the company top-heavy with highly paid executives. But as the company becomes more established, so should the boundaries between its finance, operations and legal departments — to avoid overloading your boss, and to prevent the temptation to cut corners and fudge numbers.Finally, you should not feel shame or any need to justify being unable or unwilling to cover your employer’s expenses. People with spotless credit scores and fat savings cushions are the exception in this country, and while poor money management is a popular scapegoat, many other causes are beyond individual control, including medical expenses; unemployment; rising cost of living; and decades of redlining, predatory lending, and other economic practices that have disproportionately targeted and depleted the wealth of generations of Black and Latino communities. Those of us with the luck or resources to have avoided or overcome those obstacles can still empathize with those who have not, but sometimes we need a nudge from someone in a position to speak truth to privilege."
91,"July 15, 2021","Last week’s letter from a director tired of being pressured to put hefty expenses on his personal credit card, struck a nerve with a lot of readers. Employers asking employees to cover upfront costs for travel, meals, equipment and other business expenses is a common practice — and, judging by reader responses, a largely unpopular one.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIn her early years at a large food and beverage corporation, “I was expected to front at least $3,000 per month on my own credit cards for work travel,” wrote Jessica, a New York City resident who asked to have her last name withheld because she’s still at the same company. “I was always reimbursed eventually, but sometimes it took weeks, so my credit card would be maxed out and I would have to use my own checking account for additional business expenses.”Story continues below  A number of people on social media and The Washington Post comment boards pointed out that they enjoy the cash returns, points or frequent flier miles they earn from temporarily carrying large employer expenses on their personal credit cards. Others said being able to charge and then quickly pay off balances helped them build or improve their credit.Expense retorts: Workers question paying for trade shows, bad coffeeBut to take advantage of those benefits, you have to be in a position of relative financial security, which means having: (1) a stable employer that provides timely reimbursement, (2) a high enough credit limit to accommodate a big balance, (3) cash to pay the balance if reimbursement is delayed and (4) the abililty to cover your personal expenses in the meantime.AdvertisementReaders without those resources described having to eat the cost of interest charges or late fees when reimbursement came late — or getting stuck with the entire balance when reimbursement never came. And, adding insult to insolvency, those without adequate borrowing power to cover work expenses can find themselves in humiliating situations, or missing out on career opportunities.Story continues below  “During the first few years of working after college … I was kicked out of a hotel because they bounced my credit card. ... I had to pay cash and beg my manager for a cash loan,” commenter frankdunn1 posted on the Post comment boards.“My first year in a government job I cried when I was told I had to put the cost of a conference on my credit card [and] wait to be reimbursed,” a Washingtonpost.com user with the handle Ann Jay recalled. ""I couldn’t attend the conference because I only had one credit card at the time and was still carrying a balance from when I [moved] to a new state. ... I won’t ever forget my coworkers getting to go to a work conference because they could afford to and I couldn’t.”AdvertisementAnother concern with “pay now, get reimbursed later” practices is that they can be exploited by scammers posing as legitimate businesses. An Atlanta tech industry worker, Lynn M., found that out the hard way. ""I was recently scammed by a [fake employer that made a job offer contingent on completing training, and then during the purported training asked me to pay for software] on my personal card and then the “business” would ""reimburse’ me.” The worker has reported the scam to authorities, but adds, “I’ve been beating myself up and asking myself why I was okay with doing this.”Work Advice: Beware the crafty job scammers, even on trusted job sitesI’ll tell you why: When we’re told practices like this are “just how business works,” we’re less likely to question them until it’s too late. Those who can’t afford to simply walk away from a potential paycheck, however dodgy the circumstances, are the most vulnerable.Story continues below  Bottom line: Even if it’s legal, having employees carry business expenses beyond their means promotes economic and employment inequality. Employees’ access to job opportunities and employer resources should not be limited by their personal cash flow or credit scores. Whether through corporate cards, cash advances, master billing for travel, or other solutions, employers should do what they can to avoid burdening employees with job-related expenses. “You gotta spend money to make money” was never meant to apply to those earning an honest wage.AdvertisementIncidentally, the reader whose letter sparked this discussion has an update. Following a “glowing” performance review from his boss, he spoke up about the expensing issue.“It was a bit uncomfortable but I was able to make clear that I respect our relationship, that this financial dynamic is damaging to me, and that I will be doing what is right for me and my family in how I achieve the goals of my work. …[My boss] pushed back pretty hard on trying to preserve the expense-first policy as a way to keep things simple for him, but as the intermediary between my boss and our employees for expense matters, I will be doing my best to advocate for the employees and make sure they only make expensable purchases that they individually feel financially comfortable with.”"
92,"July 22, 2021","Reader: I work for a company with 300+ employees. One of the owners, who is also the COO, doesn’t believe covid-19 is a real threat, even though he had a mild version of it. Early in the pandemic he allowed my four-person team to telework five days a week, but made clear that we would eventually be expected to come back to the office or “go our separate ways.”WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightHe ordered our small team back to work a few weeks ago. Two women, including me, are in our 50s or 60s and have grown children. The other two women have school-age children and are much younger. The owner allows the younger women to telework as needed, but not us older women, even though we can execute 100 percent of our duties from home. We expressed health concerns, and I confronted the owner about his discriminatory policy, but he says the only options are report to work, quit or be fired.America’s workers are exhausted and burned out — and some employers are taking noticeThe office environment is toxic and I would like the same opportunity to telework as the younger women.   I don’t need the money but want to keep working. I’ve consulted an employment attorney, who thinks any legal action I bring would be settled out of court with the company paying me off. I really think the owner will continue mistreating subordinates unless someone stands up to him, but should I be the one?Karla: For months, employers with remote workforces and their teleworking employees have been preparing their arguments for what the post-pandemic workplace should look like.Employers who want everyone back at the workplace argue that employees are more engaged, more efficient and more collaborative in the office. But teleworking employees who have adapted to online collaboration, and who find they have more mental energy without office distractions and draining commutes, aren’t necessarily buying those reasons. And with coronavirus variants threatening another surge in infection rates, safety is still a major concern.Seeking clarity: How the concept of work has shiftedBy the same token, anyone who’s pleading health concerns while resuming pre-pandemic social and vacation habits isn’t presenting a convincing argument for teleworking, either. I’m not saying that’s what you’re doing, but it sounds as though avoiding the preexisting toxic work environment is at least as much a motivating factor for you as avoiding the coronavirus.   That’s certainly understandable — but in an at-will employment arrangement, when employers generally have flexibility to set take-it-or-leave-it rules, you’ll need something more persuasive.Ideally, employers and employees should be transparent and willing to compromise on what they want from each other. “I’m cautioning my clients … to be flexible,” says Amy Epstein Gluck, an employment law partner with FisherBroyles.Washingtonian staff goes on publishing strike after CEO’s op-ed about remote workShe advises employers to open discussions, rather than issue mandates — “We’re coming back to the office; if there’s a reason you can’t come back to the office, let’s discuss” — and to be especially mindful of individual worker situations entitled to accommodation or protection under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act or the Family and Medical Leave Act, as well as state laws. Are the employees caregivers to children or immunocompromised people? Are they pregnant or immunocompromised themselves? Do they have diagnosed anxiety, PTSD or other mental and emotional aftereffects from living through a pandemic?   A lot of employees’ personal situations have been affected by the pandemic, so employers may need to reset their expectations. And employees should be mindful that what they see as a new normal, their employers may see as emergency measures that were never meant to be permanent.In any case, your owner’s like-it-or-lump-it stance doesn’t leave much room for discussion. Maybe he feels that allowing parents of minor children to telecommute is a reasonable line to draw; however, even if he doesn’t intend to target older workers for separate treatment, he needs to consider the effective impact of his decision.Microaggressions at the office can make remote work even more appealing“If you’re offering flexibility to other workers and you’re treating older workers, comparable workers, less favorably because of their age, that could be a problem,” says Epstein Gluck. Even if the boss isn’t explicitly basing his decision on your age, however, his policy could still have what’s known as a disparate impact on older workers. “Disparate impact is an unintended consequence of a neutral rule on an impacted group,” Epstein Gluck explains. “If this would inadvertently negatively impact another group, whether intentionally or not, then the employer could have some risk.”I’m not saying you should seek to apply legal leverage, either through the EEOC or the lawyer you consulted. It’s stressful, with no guarantee that you’ll effect change. However, if you feel strongly enough that none of the outcomes your boss offers is acceptable for you or your colleagues, and you’re financially secure with or without this job, it’s certainly an option."
93,"July 29, 2021","Reader: I am a 16-year-old girl hired to lifeguard at my local pool for $12.50/hour. Another teen girl, Natasha, was hired later at the same rate. I recently learned we were both being paid less than two male lifeguards, Steve and Tony, who were hired after both of us at $14/hour. I am friends with Steve and Tony, we are the same age and have the same prior experience, and we all work part-time doing exactly the same job.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightI emailed the pool management company and asked to be paid the same as Steve and Tony. The pool company then asked me for my availability, which was strange because they already had our schedules. The pool company then lowered Steve’s hourly rate to $12.50 and Tony’s to $13 and raised Natasha’s to $13. They did not change my rate. The pool company claimed they had reviewed our “availability” and that this “triggered” the new pay rates. But I was not any less available to work than the boys were, and the company had never before indicated our wage would fluctuate based on availability. Also, they never explained exactly what kind of availability qualified for each hourly rate. It felt like they were looking for an excuse for why I was being paid less.After doing some research online, I sent another email pointing out that it’s illegal to pay different wages to men and women doing the same job and also illegal to reduce the wages of either sex to equalize their pay. The pool company then said they were going to start paying all of us $13.50/hour with a bonus for anyone completing over a certain number of hours. That is still lower than the wage Steve and Tony were hired at.   I believe I should be paid $14/hour retroactive to the day I began working. What do you think?Karla: What I think is that I’m about to get inundated with employment attorneys who want to either take your case or offer you an internship.Lisa Schnall, a senior attorney-adviser in the EEOC Office of Legal Counsel, couldn’t address whether your specific situation is legal without knowing all the details. But she did reply that it “raises potential issues under the Equal Pay Act, which requires that men and women who perform substantially equal work receive equal pay, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits, among other things, sex discrimination in employment, including with respect to compensation.” Schnall also confirmed that “the EPA expressly prohibits lowering the pay of any employee to correct a pay differential that violates the EPA.”   So, yeah, it sounds like your employer goofed once by paying male and female lifeguards different rates for doing the same job, and then again by cutting the guys’ pay in an attempt to even things out.Maybe the pay disparity was due to sex bias — for example, hiring managers assuming boys could do the job better than girls regardless of training, or that boys need more money for dates. (Fun fact: “He has a family to support” used to be a common justification for paying married men more than women.)Work Advice: When an employer actually needs 'the best man for the job'Or maybe it had nothing to do with bias. Teen lifeguards are in short supply nationally; it’s possible that after hiring you and Natasha, your employer upped its ante to attract more candidates, so later applicants got better offers.Story continues below  But whatever the reasoning, the result was still that equally qualified male and female employees were doing the same job for different pay rates, so you were justified in questioning it. There still may be legitimate reasons for that pay discrepancy — but the pool company suddenly retconning rates on the vague basis of “availability” only after you pointed it out “sounds fishy to me,” says Amy Epstein Gluck, employment law partner with FisherBroyles.AdvertisementSo what should you do now?Learn your rights. You seem to have this covered, but for general information: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has a Youth@Work website that spells out those rights clearly. Your state’s employment agency may have even stricter equal-pay rules; WorkplaceFairness.org has handy links for each state.Work Advice: Summer job pay leaves teen's parent coldGather your proof. Document dates, names, conversations. Keep all emails. Organize your pay stubs and any other evidence of hours you’ve worked and pay you’ve received.Story continues below  File a complaint. You can submit a wage discrimination complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission through its online portal or one of its field offices, or call 800-669-4000 to get started. You should file with your state, too. It may take months for your filings to work their way through the system, and there are deadlines for filing after an incident, so get that ball rolling sooner rather than later.AdvertisementBe proud. It’s not easy challenging your employer, even as an adult. And your complaint may not get the results you’re hoping for. But this is excellent practice for learning to advocate for yourself, even if it’s not the kind of work experience you were expecting from a summer job.Pro tip: Epstein Gluck recommends that employers periodically audit pay practices “especially as we go back to the workplace,” to make sure they’re compensating workers appropriately and equitably based on performance, not on irrelevant or possibly discriminatory factors."
94,"August 5, 2021","After a teen lifeguard described her frustration at being paid less than her male teen colleagues, Washington Post readers applauded her courage and persistence and shared their experiences with pay inequality.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightPatricia Digby Ellis of Williamsburg, Va., had a similar experience as a 16-year-old lifeguard in 1956. “I complained to my mother, and she told me to go to the head of the camp, and if I didn’t succeed, she would intervene.” Although she was scared to speak up, Ellis said, her boss heard her out — and agreed. “I won the same salary [as the boys] and the back pay. Sadly, that was not the only time I was discriminated against because of sex or age.”Story continues below  As a single mother and the lowest-paid research assistant among less-experienced peers on a government contracting team in the 1980s, Marcia McDevitt of Reston, Va., said she asked for a raise but was told by her boss, “You get child support, you don’t need money.” Readers described seeing male colleagues getting raises and promotions because “they had families to support” — through the 1960s, ‘70s, and the present day.AdvertisementWhile laws like the Equal Pay Act have made it easier to combat such blatant bias, subtler forms of discrimination in hiring and compensation persist, contributing to the pay gap between men and women. A Pew Research Center analysis puts overall women’s earnings at 84 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2020. And it’s worse for women of color. The National Women’s Law Center estimates the pay gap for Black women at 63 cents for each dollar earned by White men.D.C. has the widest wage gap for Black women. This 72-year-old doesn’t need data to know that.Skeptics will consistently attribute the pay gap not to gender or race bias, but to personal choices, such as taking time off to raise children — but that clearly wasn’t a factor for last week’s teen lifeguard, who was hobbled with a lower wage right out of the starting gate. Speaking of whom, she has an update:Work Advice: On this Mother's Day, the crisis for working moms is hard to missAfter the pool company told us they were going to start paying us all the same wage of $13.50, I replied that this still did not address the initial wage disparity where Steve and Tony were making $14/hour while Natasha and I were making $12.50. Steve and another lifeguard, a woman who was making more than us and whose pay was not affected by the change, also weighed in. None of us got replies. Steve, the woman and I quit. The day after we quit, the company gave the remaining lifeguards (Tony and Natasha) a big pay raise to $15.50/hour.   I took the first step in filing a complaint with the EEOC by filling out their online inquiry form, and I should have an interview with EEOC staff later this fall. I am also preparing a complaint for my state’s employment agency.What I found surprising and upsetting was adults in my community who didn’t think I should have said anything. One mom told me I should be careful about complaining because they could fire me. One dad told my mom the wage difference was just a fact of life. Another said it was my fault because I didn’t ask for more money when I was hired. (I actually had asked for more on my application form but was told they could only pay me $12.50.)Work Advice: What to do when a job application asks for your salary historyBut I am encouraged by the supportive comments on washingtonpost.com. I didn’t realize how many women in different jobs have had wage discrimination happen to them.   I am lucky I had the luxury of quitting. I am not supporting a family. I don’t have debt or living expenses. But just because I am a teenager doesn't mean I shouldn't be treated fairly by my employer!Karla: I’m delighted that so many are standing with you, and disappointed — though not surprised — that others would stand in your way.Work Advice: A reading list for millennial women as they launch their careersSome people have to experience or witness injustice firsthand before they believe it exists. Some have trouble recognizing anything subtler than overt discrimination as a problem. Some want to steer you away from taking action because they know exactly how hard the powers that be can hit back when challenged.That’s why it’s all the more important for those who have energy for outrage, awareness of their own rights and privileges, a keen eye for subtle inequality, and relatively little at risk to speak up on behalf of themselves and others. Like you and Steve and your adult colleague. That’s how we overcome “It is what it is” inertia and nudge reality closer to “It will be what it should be.” That’s why so many readers are rooting for you and looking forward to an update from you in the coming months."
95,"August 12, 2021","Reader: I recently returned to the workforce after being a stay-at-home dad for many years. After bouncing around a couple of jobs, I landed one I thought was great — good pay, short commute (currently remote) and regular hours. My supervisor is wonderful to work with in almost every way and a great person. However, the content of my job is stupefyingly boring, as in I cannot concentrate on it for more than about 10 minutes before my mind wanders. I am frustrated and bored, sometimes almost to tears. It is also affecting my job performance; I am a subpar employee for the first time in my life. I cannot imagine doing this for six more months, let alone six more years.However, I also cannot face having to start over with applications, interviews and becoming the most junior member of a team again. I also am concerned about switching jobs four times in four years at age 50. And I know my spouse would be very frustrated were I to quit. There is no way to make this job interesting — trust me — and yet no way out without significant pain on a variety of levels. I feel stuck and without any recourse. This is a really lousy way to spend my days. Maybe you have some thoughts?WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightWork Advice: When will it be fathers' day in the office?Karla: It does feel unfair, at 50, to be put in the position of a child having to plow through busywork. But surely, as an at-home dad, you’re a veteran of mind-numbing and repetitive tasks: changing diapers, washing bottles, packing lunches, sorting clothes, reading the same books every night. There’s nothing stimulating about these tasks, but they have to be performed to a particular standard, day after day. The payoff is in the form of clean, well-fed, well-loved little humans who may not ever thank you for your toil.   Now you’re buried in a new kind of drudgery for which you’re being financially compensated. Most jobs have some element of tedium; far fewer include a great boss and no commute. Plus, as you say, quitting would jeopardize your professional progress and possibly your marriage. Your spouse probably endured their share of frustration and boredom over the years at work as your family’s breadwinner. So you owe it to them and yourself to try to make this work just a bit longer, or at least not abandon it until you have a firm grasp on something demonstrably better.I believe you that the work itself can’t be made more interesting, but strategizing about how to tackle the job can make it less overwhelming. For example, there’s nothing like a looming deadline to help sharpen focus, whether it comes from a calendar or a clock or a napping baby. (Ask me how I know.) Sometimes you have to invent artificial deadlines; one popular approach is the Pomodoro technique, which involves breaking your day into strict 25-minute segments followed by five-minute breaks. The key is that you don’t let distractions interrupt your brief work shifts, and you spend your breaks doing something entirely different from work. Instead of gazing in despair at the months or years ahead, you’re focused just on getting through the next 25 minutes.Work Advice: I'm forgetful and disorganized, but I don't know how to pull it togetherCompressing your overall work day is another idea. When I transitioned from maternity leave back to full-time work via a week of half days, it was surprising how efficient I became when I knew I didn’t have a full eight hours to get the work done. Reducing your daily hours may not be feasible, but you may be able to break up your eight-hour daily marathon into sprints of two or four hours with clean breaks in between to rest or play or tackle a chore. This will probably mean starting and ending your day outside traditional business hours — something many of us working from home during the pandemic have been doing anyway — so make sure you clear it with your boss and make your availability known.   Finally, are there any tasks you could take on in addition to your primary job that will expand your skills or fix a problematic process or expand your in-house network? I’m leery of “hustle culture” that involves juggling multiple fragments of jobs 24/7, but sometimes a temporary side quest can provide a challenging foil to your daily grind.You also might be combating the comforts and distractions of working from home, when the reward of completing the task on your computer screen seems abstract in comparison to, say, tackling some dishes or fixing something to eat. Without a commute or change of scenery, you’re not making the physical transition that switches your brain from home to work mode. You might be able to force that flip with a daily walk, workout, shave or other ritual.Finally — and this is completely outside my wheelhouse — if none of these techniques helps you make any headway, and especially if this inability to complete tedious tasks is a long-term issue, you may want to consult a doctor to see if therapeutic or medical intervention could help you break through."
96,"August 26, 2021","WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightReader: When I first started working, work advice columnists suggested asking, “Why is this position open? Why did the prior person leave?” in interviews as a way to learn more about the office culture and potential problems with the employer.When I did that last year, the interviewer became indignant, saying that asking why the prior employee left was inappropriate and that I was asking about a private personnel matter.Is that true? I understand that personnel matters are private to the individual, but are they private to the company? Of course, I don’t want to anger the interviewer. Have times changed so much that what was once considered an appropriate and smart question is now bad form?Story continues below  Karla: As an old-timer who’s been in this gig nigh on a decade —(spits coffee grounds)— here’s my cynical take: Interviews are as much about avoiding bad picks as they are about making good ones. Both parties try to cast themselves in the best possible light, while examining the other side’s shadows as subtly as possible.Nearly a third of U.S. workers under 40 considered changing careers during the pandemicThe employer is looking for reasons not to hire you. But instead of blurting, “So what’s wrong with you?” the interviewer will ask why you’re interested in the job and have you explain any gaps in your work history, and form an impression based on how you answer — or don’t answer — the questions.AdvertisementOn the other side of the conversation, even though you’re there to sell yourself as a great candidate, you also should be looking for warning signs why you wouldn’t want to work for that employer. But instead of asking, “What’s wrong with this job?” you ask about the work environment and management’s expectations, keeping one ear trained on the silence between the lines.Story continues below  In any case, your asking why the position you’re applying for was vacated is every bit as appropriate as an interviewer asking why you left/are leaving your old job. Rather than getting huffy and telling them that’s none of their beeswax, you would probably have anticipated and practiced answering that question, especially if the circumstances were dodgy.Likewise, seasoned interviewers will anticipate your curiosity and will have prepared some bland response, perhaps with a gentle deflection away from the question they can’t or don’t want to answer to the question they would prefer you had asked. The fact that your interviewer went into puffer fish mode and tried to shame you for committing some alleged breach of business etiquette should absolutely trip your warning system.Work Advice: The waiting game: What to do when a prospective employer keeps you hangingOf course, a clumsy interviewer might not have anything nefarious to hide, and smooth, neutral answers can hide a multitude of sins.   That’s what reference checks are for. Glassdoor and LinkedIn may offer clues or connections to people willing to speak freely about employers, and you can always ask to speak with prospective co-workers to get a sense of the work culture.Back to your original question, it’s true that some interview questions once considered reasonable are now deemed inappropriate because they might indicate an illegal hiring bias, such as, “Do you have kids or plan on having any?” So employers have learned to ask less personal, more job-centered questions to get at what they really want to know: Are you available to work on short notice? Can you maintain consistent working hours? What are your goals beyond landing this job?So again, while nothing about your original question was inappropriate as far as I can see, if this experience has left you gun-shy, you could retool your interview questions to focus on the job itself and what it requires, such as:   -When and why was this position created?-What would you say is the average amount of time people spend in this position?-What would you say are characteristics of people who have been the most successful in this position?That leaves it up to the interviewer to disclose as much or as little about individual personnel as feels appropriate, while giving you an opportunity to listen for clues about whether the job is a good fit for you."
