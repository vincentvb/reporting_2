0,2020-03-05,"I am a widower of five years. Two years ago, I started dating another woman. At that time, I removed all pictures of my late wife from around the house, and I consciously do not speak of her out of sensitivity to my new relationship. The one exception I make is with the wallpaper photo on my cellphone, which is of my departed wife. I want never to forget her, and seeing her face frequently on my phone helps me to keep that pledge. My current love objects to this picture on my phone, though, and wants me to remove my late wife’s image. What do you think?on’t let anyone, including your girlfriend or me, tell you how to grieve or when to move on. Only you know what you need, Bill. We all heal at different paces and fall back into stabbing sadness at unexpected intervals. So, I will gladly share my thoughts, if you promise that you will be the final arbiter here.You may have overdone it by going cold turkey on your late wife: removing all pictures of her from your home and never talking about your marriage with your girlfriend. I respect your thoughtful motivation, but acting as if a huge part of your life never happened probably wasn’t healthy for you or your new relationship.Try revisiting these issues with your girlfriend now. (I also get that seeing a picture of your late wife flash onto your phone 10 times a day could be upsetting to her.) Perhaps restoring some photos around the house and sharing tales from your marriage will help you keep important memories alive, allow your girlfriend to know you better and let you change your phone’s (high-visibility) wallpaper, too?.Christoph NiemannI Owe You NothingMy friend’s boyfriend sent a group text to me and five of her close friends inviting us to a surprise brunch for her birthday. She was turning 31. We all said yes. I even got a sitter and brought my husband. When we arrived, the food kept coming. It was more than I needed, but it was delicious. My friend told us how sweet her boyfriend is: “Aw, he brought me pancakes in bed this morning.” The boyfriend added: “I’m not into buying material things. I’m an experience guy.” When we were leaving, he asked: “Do you want to pay now, or should I text what you owe?” I was shocked. It was a brunch. We’re adults. He invited us. And he’s the “experience guy.” Should I say something?’m struggling to understand the true source of your aggravation. Sure, the boyfriend should have been clear from the beginning that he wasn’t paying for your meal. (Maybe he couldn’t afford to if there were other plus-ones?) Still, it’s just a garden-variety error. His bad!But you seem more annoyed by his taste for experiential gifts: spending the morning in bed with pancakes instead of opening velvet boxes from Harry Winston. The “experience” of brunch, though, is friendly connections over good food (at an awkward hour), not necessarily who pays for it.I wouldn’t say anything. The boyfriend’s taste in gifts (which I like, but suspect you don’t) is none of our business. If you want to be remembered as a pill, send a snarky note with your Venmo payment. Otherwise, be happy for your happy friend — and ask about payment the next time the boyfriend invites you to dine.Political DivideI have a friend who is strongly opinionated like me. Recently, we were watching a political debate, and I suggested that one of the candidates would be better suited to a cabinet position. This led to a long, drawn-out debate on both sides that ended in mutual silence. We haven’t spoken since. Should I drop this person as a friend?f you (and your friend) are so self-important that you believe others must bend to your will on all matters, including the makeup of fantasy political cabinets, then, yes, drop this person as a friend at once. Otherwise, simply agree to disagree and move on to your next debate. The strongly opinionated need worthy opponents more than most!Shh!I have become a crank about people who walk down the street, wait for the bus, stand in elevators, etc. while shouting into their cellphones. I’m pretty good at asking people politely to lower their voices when they’re on too-loud calls in restaurants. (That’s clearly a shared space.) But is it too much to ask of people on the street?ot at all — as long as you are prepared for a range of responses. At bus stops and elevators, ask in the same polite way you do in restaurants: “Could you lower your voice, please?”This has become a perverse hobby of mine: I feel vindicated when phone screamers nod and speak more quietly, and secretly amused when they explode and start swearing like Susie Essman on “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” (If this prospect upsets you, keep quiet. It really happens!)"
1,2020-03-12,"My husband believes that I am a germaphobe, and I believe he could be more vigilant. I love him, but he has a habit of touching his face during meals, then bringing his fingers to his mouth (to lick crumbs from them or put more food in). With the coronavirus, much of the media has been telling us that touching our faces is a big no-no. How do I gently impress on him that his habit is gross, as well as a potential gateway for infecting himself and others?s the designated disgusting person in my marriage, I am thrilled that you came to me with your question. Here’s the rub: You make an excellent epidemiological point. (We should all stop touching our faces.) But you made it using the language of disgust. You called your husband’s habit “gross.” (And it is!)But visceral judgment like that will probably just hurt his feelings and make him defensive. Not helpful to your cause! Try to hide your revulsion and use neutral language about his behavior. If the coronavirus and gentle reminders are not enough to quell his face touching, ask him to wash his hands frequently. That helps, too..Christoph NiemannI’m Not Allowed to Dislike My Dad’s Fiancée?My brother and I are teens. Our parents divorced five years ago. We live with our mom full time and see our dad when he is available or feels like it. He has been dating another woman for seven years, and now they are getting married. Our dad has always wanted us to know his girlfriend and act like we love her. We’ve met her three times. (She lives in another state.) My brother doesn’t like her, and I can’t stand being around her. My dad tries to make us feel guilty by telling us we have to be open-minded. I agree, but it doesn’t feel authentic to be with them. She’s coming to visit. Advice?, 16Let’s start with some things that would have been news to me at 16: Your father may have been a terrible husband, but he can still be a good parent to you. And there is no disloyalty to your mother in being more open to your father and his girlfriend. Try it, even if it feels awkward now. (Of course it’s inauthentic. You barely know her!)You don’t specify your problem with his girlfriend. But you lay it on pretty thick with your dad: He only sees you when “he feels like it,” and he makes you feel guilty about his girlfriend. I don’t know him. He may be a monster. But if he didn’t love you and your brother, wouldn’t he have stopped trying to bring you into his life by now?Have an honest conversation with him before his girlfriend’s visit. If possible, a family counselor may be a big help here. (Ask your father about one.) You may find his girlfriend isn’t even the issue; She may just be a place holder for your hurt and anger toward him.These talks won’t be easy. But if you all commit to them, it’s worth a try. I respect your discomfort with the couple. It’s not fair to write off a person based on three stiff meetings, though. Try to suspend judgment for now. You’ve only got one dad. If he (and his girlfriend) are willing to put in the work, don’t throw in the towel yet.Performance AnxietyI swim on my college team, and not to brag or anything, but I do really well. I love practices and my teammates. But the actual swim meets make me super anxious. I hate the experience beforehand, but I love having raced after the fact — if that makes sense. Any advice? played tennis in school, and not to brag or anything, but I was definitely the worst player on the team. (Oh, and I threw up from nerves before most matches.) I understand exactly what you’re saying. Competing can be terrifying.Talk with a few close teammates about your pre-race jitters. I bet many of them feel just like you. You can support each other. Also, start meditating. A short daily practice (with a group or an app) can help reduce anxiety. Here’s a sad fact, though: Even when we’re totally prepared, sometimes we have to swim scared.No Body TalkMy close friend (a 28-year-old man) married a wonderful guy three years ago. They were both very fit. The husband is still fit, but my friend has gained a shocking amount of weight. (I’m talking 100 pounds!) I am really concerned for his health. When I mentioned my worry to his husband, he patted my friend’s huge belly and said: “More of him to love.” Should I let this go, or try to find out what’s going on? know you mean well. But the intensity of our curiosity about a subject does not make it our business if it is not. And your friend’s body is none of yours. He and his husband have surely noticed his weight gain. And neither of them has asked for your help. I’d back off."
2,2020-03-19,"Thanks to the new coronavirus, my son’s basketball tournament was canceled last week. (He is 12 and plays in a middle school league.) He loves the game, so I understood his disappointment at the announcement. But I am surprised by his seeming inability to bounce back from it. We watch the evening news as a family, so he sees the much harder toll Covid-19 is taking on others. (Basically, he’s on vacation in a nice, safe house.) Still, he moans about the canceled tournament and keeps asking if I think it will be reinstated. Any advice for dealing with childish selfishness during a pandemic? et me start by sharing my hunch that this is actually the tale of a good parent momentarily blinded by the new stresses we are all now facing. But frankly, I am more surprised by your lack of compassion for your son than by his whining.Meet your child on his level! It’s not his fault that the great worries of his comfortable life are what’s for dinner and his canceled tournament. It wouldn’t surprise me, either, if his outsize distress is partly a stand-in for his anxiety over Covid-19. Sympathize with him, even as you underscore the importance of keeping people healthy.You also mention watching the evening news as a family. That could be scary for anyone these days! So, build in plenty of time for discussion afterward. Ask your son: “Which story grabbed you tonight?” And keep talking (even about basketball!) until you hear his reassurance that you are going to keep him safe..Christoph NiemannUnrequited Eye ContactI am a happily married, middle-aged man living in the suburbs with my wife and children. A seemingly happily married, attractive, middle-aged woman and I used to have friendly chats when we met. (Our children are friends.) One day, at a kids’ sports game, she made eye contact with me from a distance, smiled and flipped her hair a few times. I was surprised and didn’t react or respond. Since then, when I see her, she looks away and doesn’t talk to me. She acts as if I’ve done something wrong. Do I owe her an explanation of why I’m not interested in what she’s interested in, or should I let her cold shoulder continue indefinitely? am no expert in suburban adultery (though I have read most of John Cheever). If this woman wanted to make a pass at you, though, wouldn’t she do it in the privacy of your one-on-one chats, rather than at a distance, in front of other parents and possibly your spouses? Your reading seems like a self-congratulatory stretch to me. Sometimes a hair toss is just a hair toss — especially if she’d just had a blowout.Isn’t it more likely that your ignoring her at the game hurt her feelings? (Hence the cold shoulder.) Even if you’re right, you’ve given her your answer. Now, it’s time to break down the cold front. The next time you meet, reset your friendship by saying, “Nice to see you! All well?”Typos? At a Time Like This?My grandfather died recently, a devastating loss. I told one of my best friends, who began texting me weekly with messages of concern that seemed hurtfully casual to me: loaded with typos and slang. I withdrew from her, and she became anxious about it and sought an explanation. I suggested we speak over the phone (rather than text) when she was less anxious and an honest conversation would be possible. Weeks later, I woke to an email from her that said my hinting she had done something wrong, without telling her what it was, constituted emotional abuse, and our friendship was over. Shouldn’t I have been allowed to focus on my grief rather than my careless friend? And shouldn’t condolence notes come without typos?D.L.So many hurts here: the death of your grandfather; your friend’s failure to pick up the phone when you asked her to call; the lack of confidence that ate at her after you suggested she’d upset you; and your inability to see the love in numerous expressions of concern for you because of some silly typos.I hope you reach out to her when you start to feel better. (If she’d written to me, I would tell her the same thing.) When we condition our best friendships on perfect behavior, we all lose. And haven’t you both lost enough already?Neighborly NicetiesI live in a building with 24 units. Most residents are friendly. The owners of two condos, however, do not respond when I say hello to them in common areas. I have finally given up and taken their lead: I walk by wordlessly. Is this right?T.L.M.What’s better than the easy bonhomie of a neighborly acquaintance? So little effort, so much good will! Your silent neighbors seem to feel differently, though. It’s probably not personal. If this really bugs you, try introducing yourself. The additional data may tip their scales toward “Good morning!” Or simply accept their deep introversion (or serious disinterest in you). There is no law that mandates lobby greetings."
3,2020-03-26,"My wife and I have a 25-year-old son who has sadly failed to launch. He lives in a shared apartment with many roommates. Still, he brings his dirty laundry home and eats dinner with us frequently because, we suspect, it’s free. He hasn’t found anything like a career path. We can almost deal with all of this. What we can’t deal with is his irresponsible behavior during our national period of “social distancing” to help contain Covid-19. When we challenge him about his partying and hanging out with large groups of friends, he shrugs us off — as if he wasn’t endangering himself and others. Any advice?G.G.Let’s start gentle, then get tough (as needed). Stop saying your son has “failed to launch.” It’s too soon to know and would likely hurt his feelings. Being 25 is harder today than it was when we were kids — and that was before Covid-19!The gig economy, sky-high rents and staggering student debt loads have hamstrung many young people. But I won’t be your son’s apologist, either. When he brings home dirty laundry, let him wash it. If he turns up for dinner, have him do the dishes.As for all-important social distancing, I mostly disagree with the army of pundits who ascribe recklessness like your son’s to the “invincibility of youth.” When I was 25 and terrified of H.I.V. transmission, “invincible” is the last name you would have called me. I’ve also seen many responsible young people in action in recent weeks.No, personal sacrifice for the greater good (and not merely for people whose names we know) is a muscle that must be exercised to become strong. And it hasn’t been asked of us seriously as Americans since World War . We’re out of shape!It’s being asked of us now, though. Speak calmly with your son about his duty to you and the community. Then add some teeth: Shut down the free laundry, food service and other perks until he falls into line. Allowing him access to your home while he behaves irresponsibly puts you at risk and makes you complicit in the spread of this pandemic..Christoph NiemannSeeking Privacy in a PandemicI am a European student enrolled at an American college. When we were asked to leave campus for the rest of the semester, a good friend invited me to stay with her family nearby. I agreed, and I’m extremely grateful to her. The problem: We share a bedroom and stay together for most of the day. The lack of privacy is killing me. Is it rude to ask for time alone? I don’t want to hurt her feelings.hat a generous friend (and family)! I totally get your concern. But everyone needs private time — including your friend, I bet. She may think she’s being a good host by sticking close. Tell her you’d like to take a solitary walk to clear your head, if she wouldn’t mind. (She won’t.) Many of us are feeling cooped up now. But carving out some breathing room is a basic necessity of self-care.What’s Wrong With Splitting?I have a friend with whom I eat at restaurants. She never agrees to share dishes we order, even when portions are huge and much goes to waste. (She also refuses to take uneaten food home with her.) Many times, I’ve suggested splitting a pasta or salad and asking the server to bring it on separate plates. She refuses! Finally, she told me that asking restaurants to split orders is bad manners. I feel insulted. I come from a culture where sharing food is part of the emotional connection of a meal. Your thoughts?J.R.Remember the good old days of in-restaurant dining?My favorite objection in courtroom dramas is “asked and answered.” It cuts down on repetition. With due respect to your culture, once your friend let you know she was uncomfortable sharing food, why keep pressing her? You asked; she answered.In your defense: Requesting that servers split orders doesn’t seem like bad manners to me. Many restaurants are happy to oblige; some charge an order-splitting fee. But badgering people is wrong. And doing so until they inadvertently hurt us is one of the prime reasons.Pay What You CanI take yoga classes at a small studio. They have moved classes online for the time being. The online classes are free, but the studio suggests a donation of $5 per class. The problem: I’ve been laid off because of the pandemic, and even though $5 sounds like nothing, I have no idea how long my small savings will last or when I’ll return to work. Is it wrong to skip the suggested donation?ake the studio at its word: For now, classes are free. If you feel uncomfortable not making the suggested donation, email the studio manager to discuss your predicament.Let him or her know you’ll do your best to make it up to the studio when you’re back on your feet. For those who can afford to make more than suggested donations to small businesses you value: Now is the time! We really are all in this together."
4,2020-04-02,"A couple of weeks ago, before Covid-19 exploded in New York, a close friend asked if she and her husband could leave Manhattan and stay with us at our home in Bergen County, N.J. It was a tough question to have asked of me, but I decided it was the right thing to do. I told my friend they could come. For other reasons, they didn’t. Now, she’s asked again. They’re really scared! I’m not sure what to do. My husband has asthma, they would have to share a bathroom with my cranky 19-year-old son, and I am helping my elderly mother who lives nearby (contact-free). Any advice?D.I love your compassion for your friend and her fears! (If you look for it, every day brings so much kindness amid the suffering.) Still, it would be unwise to invite your friends into your home now.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an advisory urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to stop nonessential domestic travel for two weeks. Even absent that, I worry for your husband with a respiratory illness and for the increased risk to your mother.I also know how wrenching it feels to refuse a friend in need. And New York is scary now. But we know how to keep safe. Tell her: “I’m sorry I can’t invite you to stay with us now. With my husband’s asthma and my mother’s age, we have to be vigilant about social distancing and following the advice of the C.D.C.”Let’s be realistic, too. Your friend may be hurt by your refusal. If she’s cold or lashes out, try to remember that her response is likely driven by fear. So, be generous. Keep checking in with her. The voice call has been a major comfort to me lately. Use it liberally to keep your close friend close..Christoph NiemannBut My Roots!Don’t get mad at me for asking this! But since we began isolating at home and all the salons closed, my hair has become a disaster! My roots are terrifying — and only getting worse. Would it be wrong to call my hair stylist and ask about her social distancing practices, and if they sound , beg her to color my hair?ow could I get mad at you when I’ve been eyeing a pair of office scissors all week and assessing my husband’s manual dexterity, dreading my inevitable fate? But it would be extremely wrong to ask your stylist to color your hair now. Even an infinitesimal risk of exposure to either of you is unacceptable.Because that danger is magnified many times over for our already overtaxed health care workers, as well as for grocery and pharmacy staffs, emergency medical workers, and others with whom you’re sheltering. Wait for the authorities to give the all-clear. Half the nation needs a cut or color now. Or, if turbans aren’t your thing, touch up your roots yourself.The Group Chat Is Out of ControlMonths ago, I was added to a group text of 14 moms with kids the same age as mine. I’m close with a couple of them, but the others are friendly acquaintances or strangers. It’s a very active thread, with everything from articles to pictures to questions like: “Any ideas about socks?” I’ve turned off the alerts, but it’s really overwhelming to look at my phone and have 45 text notifications. I’m anxious about leaving the chat because it’s announced on the thread and everyone will know. Any ideas for a tactful exit so we can all be friendly when we go back to seeing people in person?’m all ears if anyone has a life hack for leaving stressful group texts without the remaining members being notified about it. But I don’t believe it exists yet. And you’re probably overestimating the risk of upsetting people now. Sure, we’re all edgy, but the texting moms have bigger fish to fry.Respect your feelings and leave the chat. If anyone asks, say: “The volume of texts was overwhelming me.” I believe most mothers (and fathers) would sympathize with your stress. When we go back to seeing people, be pleasant to the mothers in person. I bet they’ll be pleasant right back.Triggered by the BackdropLike millions, I am working from home and spending lots of time videoconferencing with co-workers and clients. My boss conferences in from his home office, where, behind his smiling face, hangs a painting of a cyclone tearing through a city. He may be so used to it that he’s oblivious to the bad message it sends. He’s not a friend, but we have a cordial relationship. Should I point out that the painting may upset people?n dark times, it pays to be extra careful about the feelings of others. So, I appreciate what’s driving your question: Someone may be unsettled. But I can’t tell if you are. If you are actually bothered, speak up: “That painting may be a little dark for a pandemic.” Otherwise, keep quiet. The same principle that calls for special sensitivity now also means we don’t have to share every opinion."
5,2020-04-09,"I started seeing a woman three months ago. It was all progressing nicely until the virus hit. Now, we’re practicing social distancing and relegated to phone calls and texts. I’m lucky that I make a good living, and my salary has not been affected by the pandemic. But my girlfriend works in the service industry, and her income has been completely cut off. She was responsible about saving money, but she is starting to feel the squeeze and the stress. Should I offer her financial help, or is it too soon in our relationship for that?E.B.I would never knock a generous impulse like yours. But let me float another idea for you to consider: Instead of swooping in to fix your girlfriend’s problems, offer a sympathetic ear first. She may rather talk to you about her troubles than cash your check.This may not be easy for you. When we care about someone, it’s hard to watch them suffer, especially if an easy fix is available to us. But for your girlfriend, her anxiety about her predicament may loom larger than cash. And having a partner who is willing to listen and really engage with her may bring greater comfort.Now, eventually, the two of you may decide that a loan (or a gift) is a great solution to her cash crunch. Or you may conclude that it would put an awkward strain on your young relationship. Just take it slowly and talk it through together. Either way, you’ll be building the foundation for a stronger relationship..Christoph NiemannAll Zoomed OutI live on the West Coast, and my extended family lives on the East Coast. My grandmother organized a big Easter lunch on Zoom this year. The problem: I find large family gatherings aggravating in the best of times. But now, trapped indoors, I’m feeling claustrophobic and stressed enough without adding 30 triggering relatives to the equation. I just don’t have the energy for it. Usually, I can say it’s too far to travel. But that excuse is gone with video conferencing. How can I get out of this lunch (which, by the way, starts at 9 a.m. my time)?Z.I’m going to skip my usual advice, which would begin with a pretty bouquet to the people who’ve known us all our lives. I’m not even going to ask you to pop in on the video lunch for 10 minutes! I respect that you’re feeling tired and fragile now. (Many of us are right there with you.)Call your grandmother, so she doesn’t worry, and beg off the celebration. Say, “I hope you have a great time, but I can’t make it. Large video conferences overwhelm me.” If she presses, in her zeal to assemble the whole clan, be firm: “I love you. But I can’t do it.”Let me make one small pitch, though. (A leopard doesn’t change his spots overnight!) If you have individual relatives you feel close to, reach out to them during this time. You may find (or provide) unexpected comfort in your shared history. We all need to take care of ourselves now, while giving as much as we can safely manage.New Date T.B.D.Thanks to Covid-19, we must reschedule our daughter’s bat mitzvah that was set for early May. Invitations have already gone out, and we’ve received some R.S.V.P.’s and our daughter has gotten some checks in the mail. We decided not to do a Zoom event, but we haven’t finalized the new date yet. When we do, we’ll send out new invitations. But what should we do in the meantime about people who’ve already R.S.V.P.’d or sent checks?’m sorry for your daughter — and for you, too. Have faith, though! Your proud moment (and your daughter’s super fun party) will come eventually. Still, I’d hold off on making new arrangements until we know more about the course of this virus. Better to avoid the double-whammy of having to cancel the same event twice.Email all invitees to notify them of the postponement. (They may be waiting to hear from you.) Tell them you’ll send new invitations when it’s safe to plan again. Then ask your daughter to send thank-you notes to those who gave checks. Offering to return them seems like a cruel formality to me. But she can do that, if you prefer. And give her lots of space to talk about her disappointment. She’s entitled to it!That’s Not 6 Feet!When my husband and I take occasional walks outdoors, he gets aggravated and snappish with oncoming pedestrians who don’t move as far as possible to their side of the sidewalk, as we do, to maintain a safe social distance. Any advice?ou and your husband should fall into single file, move as far as possible from the thoughtless (or preoccupied) pedestrians and wait until they pass. If you can manage a friendly-sounding, “Which side do you like?” go for it. But now is no time for road rage. Nasty remarks rarely bring the pleasure we expect them to. Be safe!"
6,2020-04-16,"We live in a city that is a Covid-19 hot spot. When the news became alarming, many of our friends fled the city, leaving empty apartments behind them. We stayed. I am active on a few neighborhood social networking sites where I’ve seen posts about nurses and doctors coming from other cities to help patients in ours. But they need places to stay. I get choked up just thinking about them! Is there a nice way to ask friends who’ve left town if they would let medical personnel stay in their apartments while they’re away? A Facebook post yielded lots of likes, but no concrete offers.t’s tempting to belittle Facebook likes — so puny compared to the bravery of nurses and doctors racing to hot spots to help. But likes are a good, kind start. For many, it’s hard to imagine turning over our homes to strangers. (Taking in medical workers as guests may be easier to conceive, but that could lead to infection in this pandemic.)Still, I’m touched by your helping impulse. If you are serious about this, reach out to friends one at a time. Individual appeals carry more weight than Facebook posts. Start with close friends, especially those who have listed their apartments on Airbnb before. (They’ve worked through the logistics and liability issues already.)Say, “I have a giant ask. Would you consider letting a visiting doctor or nurse stay at your apartment while you’re away? We need them here. And I’ll have your place cleaned after they leave.” Don’t push. Let your friends mull it over. If they’re uncomfortable, consider asking if you can move into their apartment, freeing yours for emergency medical workers..Christoph NiemannSplitting Bills in a CrisisBecause of stay-at-home guidelines, I now live with a new boyfriend, which means shopping and cooking together. He eats significantly more than I do, including some foods I don’t touch. Still, we split the grocery bill, and I am paying significantly more for food than usual. How should I handle this?udging from a surge in letters like yours, Covid-19 seems to have been a powerful catalyst in persuading many couples who were living independently to give cohabitation a try. Not so easy, is it?I sympathize with your grocery woes. Try stepping back and looking at the bigger picture, though. Sure, he eats more than you, but are you twice as messy (while sharing cleaning duties equally)? Do you watch three times as much Netflix (but split the bill in half)? And I haven’t even touched on emotional labor yet!If living together is a pandemic convenience, itemize the grocery bills. But if you want your partnership to survive even after we’re set free again, consider all the contributions each of you makes. If your expenses are still off-balance, raise the issue of fairness gently. (This is a lifelong discussion for many couples.) The cost of stinky cheese, on its own, seems like the tail wagging the dog.Please Chill With the DrillWe are starting our third week of sheltering in place. Our neighbor is using this time to renovate his home. He drills, saws and hammers all day long. The noise keeps our 2-year-old awake at nap time, which is also the only time my husband and I can squeeze in uninterrupted work. I’d like to ask our neighbor if he would be willing to stop work during her nap time, but my husband thinks this might invite conflict at a time when we need to be extra polite. Thoughts?D.S.Now is definitely the moment for gentleness (on both sides of the property line). Normally, asking a neighbor to work around your daughter’s naps would strike me as excessive. But since most of us are stuck at home now, and nap time is the only time you can work in peace, I’m more understanding. Maybe your neighbor will be, too?Call him and say, “Can we ask a favor of you that we have no right to ask?” Then lay out your request for 90 minutes of quiet time during the afternoon. If he agrees, thank him profusely. If he doesn’t, remember that he wasn’t required to, and consider trading off nap-time shifts with your husband. (At least one of you can work.)This Is No Time for CommitmentsSeven days into our coronavirus quarantine, our daughter announced her engagement to her boyfriend of two years. While we are thrilled for them, she is anxious to begin planning her March wedding immediately. I know it can take a long time to plan weddings. But signing irrevocable contracts without seeing venues in person, along with the decline in the economy, seems unwise. How should I handle this without alienating my daughter?et’s hope the euphoria of her new engagement is muddling your daughter’s good sense. First, make sure she knows how happy you are for her. Then tell her gently, but as firmly as necessary, that planning a party during a pandemic is a bad look for any bride-to-be. Promise to tour venues (and florists and caterers and dress shops) in person with her just as soon as Dr. Fauci gives us the green light."
7,2020-04-23,"I had two Zoom meetings at the same time at the university where I work. I told my boss I wasn’t sure how long the first one would last, but I doubted I would make his meeting. As it happened, the first one was short, so I popped into my boss’s meeting. When I got there, my co-workers were screaming with laughter, and I heard my boss say: “The other weird thing Lauren does is….” But then he realized I was there and stopped. My co-workers looked uncomfortable, and my boss pivoted quickly by asking about my first meeting. I was mortified! It was all I could do not to cry. How can I find out what weird things I do, so I can stop? I don’t want to be the office weirdo.t is wildly unfair that you are the one feeling mortified, Lauren. And if you aren’t angry with your boss by the time you finish reading this answer, I will have failed you. He made fun of you, behind your back, to your co-workers. That is mean and unprofessional.I get your impulse to worry about your behavior when you catch other people laughing at it. But I won’t join you in blaming the victim here. Your boss’s cruelty (along with his greater power) outweighs any possible eccentricity of yours. Trust me and put aside your self-consciousness for a minute.Report the incident to your human resources officer. The fact that your boss didn’t apologize immediately after the meeting suggests he’s not a good enough manager to resolve his lapse in judgment on his own. If he has constructive criticism for you, fine. But I don’t want you working in a snake pit.This is a confusing time for many of us. We’re working, but we’re also at home — which can lead to some unprofessional moments. But cruelty toward colleagues is never . You can talk with H.R. about “weird” behavior, if you like. But don’t let that be the takeaway here. Everyone deserves respect..Christoph NiemannHow to Spend Stimulus ChecksMy boyfriend and I make less than $75,000 each. We’re still employed and working comfortably from home. Neither of us is at risk of being laid off. We recently bought a house and have costly repairs to do before we can move in. Is it selfish to spend our $1,200 stimulus checks on fixing up the house, or should we donate the money to people in need? We want to do the right thing.I.K.Your economic impact payment is all yours to spend, save or donate any way you like. It doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition, though. If you and your boyfriend are on solid financial footing — with a rainy-day fund and no mountain of credit card debt — consider a little of each. Spend some, donate some and save some.Because helping to stock the local food bank for hungry neighbors is important, and so is supporting your roofer with work, if it can be done safely. You may have the luxury of doing both, and saving for unforeseen bumps in the road, too.Dad, PleaseMy sister and I (in our 60s) live with our 95-year-old father. He is in good health, mentally sharp and stubborn. During the pandemic, my sister and I go out once a week for non-deliverable necessities. But our dad keeps insisting on going to the market himself for “essentials” (like his favorite brand of chocolate milk). He watches reputable news media that do not minimize the risks of the virus. We’re tired of arguing, and we always lose. What can we do aside from worry?ssuming your arguments focus on the health risks to your dad, try appealing to his paternal instincts, instead: Talk about the danger he may be creating for you and your sister on his shopping trips. If he’s still unpersuaded — whether out of denial, a sense of invincibility or fear turned upside down — beg him to consider the harm he may do to others in his path. And if all this fails, insist on strict social distancing and face masks.If his real problem is feeling cooped up indoors (and not the existential need for chocolate milk), discuss the safest times and places for him to get out for some fresh air.Pearls? In This Economy?Several years ago, my now former (and deceased) mother-in-law gave me her pearls. I appreciated the gesture. But I’m not the pearls type. I’m more T-shirts and jeans. Should I return the necklace to my ex, with whom I have no contact, so he can give it to his current wife, or may I sell it? gift is complete when it’s made. So, the pearls are yours to keep, sell or give away. Your mother-in-law likely gave them to you as a token of her affection. That may have changed with the divorce. But can you imagine the chaos of having to return gifts if relationships sour? (It would be enough to save the U.S. Postal Service!)Or, you may know a descendant of hers who would prize the necklace as a family heirloom more than you prize its resale value. Either way, it’s your call."
8,2020-07-02,"My ex-husband, the father of my two young children, moved to the Catskills with his girlfriend. He hasn’t been seeing our kids during the pandemic because he says his girlfriend is “terrified she will die if they visit.” She claims to have a lung issue (that he only learned about recently). The kids and I have been staying at home in Brooklyn for over a month. No one is sick. And I’ve been on my own with them this whole time. I could use a little break. Can I ask my ex to take them to the Catskills for a visit?  can only imagine how stressed out (and exhausted) you are by now! But please don’t send your children to the Catskills. It’s risky. The president’s Coronavirus Task Force calls for 14 days of self-quarantine after leaving hot spots like Brooklyn. Do you really want your kids alone in a guest room for two weeks before they join a household where one of the adults is terrified of them?It’s not fair to question the girlfriend’s recent claim of a pulmonary condition either, tempting as that may be. Before this pandemic, there was little reason to share relatively minor health problems that could be big risk factors now.You will probably notice that I’ve been no help to you so far. So, here’s an idea: Can your ex come to Brooklyn? If he stays at your apartment or finds a place nearby, he can pitch in with the kids. It’s not ideal. He will have to quarantine when he goes home again, and his girlfriend may not love the idea. Still, after a month (and counting!) on your own with two children, it’s the least he can do as a co-parent..Christoph NiemannNeighborliness Is a Two-Way StreetA woman I know has become much friendlier since our stay-at-home order was put in place. She often calls just to see how I’m doing. Then she asks whether I’m going grocery shopping and if I will pick up some things for her. I have done so a few times, dropping off her groceries in her lobby. But when I ask her to reciprocate, she says she’s too busy. Her risk from coronavirus is no greater than mine. By asking me to spend more time in stores and at her building, she is jeopardizing my health to protect her own. How can I say that I’ll help her only if she helps me?elfish friends are the worst! But for me, they are only slightly more annoying than friends who police strict tit-for-tat arrangements. I don’t like ledgers in my friendships.Sure, friends make mistakes all the time. If you actually like this woman, say: “Why do you keep asking me to shop for you?” Then discuss the imbalance. Otherwise, when she next requests delivery service, just say: “Sorry, I don’t want to prolong my time in the shops or on the street.”No Time for Inheritance TalkMy father died last week. My heart is broken. We lived in the same town, while my two sisters moved out of state. I didn’t mind taking care of him, and I mostly didn’t mind how little my sisters helped. Because of the pandemic, we can’t have a funeral now. We agreed to hold a memorial service later. My problem: The day after he died, my sisters began texting me for copies of bank statements and pictures (I’m not kidding!) of things they want. Finally, I replied: “Why don’t you pretend to grieve now? We can deal with the stuff later.” I know it was catty. And since then, silence. Help!osing a parent can be so unmooring — and we’re already living through wildly unmoored days. Perhaps a generous reading of your sisters’ speedy inventory is that they were looking for something to control at a time when there aren’t many other options. But I’m more concerned about you.Don’t beat yourself up over one mean text. Call your sisters. Apologize for being snappish and say that you (or the executor of your father’s estate, if that’s not you) will get back to them about their questions. Then share your sadness at your loss. They may respond in kind, opening a new line of communication. If they don’t, pull back and take care of yourself, ?Hey, Six Feet Please!I often see a woman in town walking a sweet dog. Somewhere along the line, we developed a routine where she lets go of the leash, and the dog comes running to me for petting. I used to love this. But now, I’m feeling so uncomfortable on the street that our routine feels almost like an assault. Am I out of line?T.M.Of course not! All kinds of things that used to feel utterly normal — remember hugging friends? — are unthinkable now. Your neighbor will understand. From a safe distance, say: “You know I love your dog. But these days, his approach makes me feel anxious. Can you keep him on the leash for now?” Don’t be afraid to air your skittish feelings. You’re in really good company."
9,2020-05-07,"We live in a suburb in the Midwest with few Covid-19 cases. While we obey our state’s shelter-in-place order, the neighborhood kids play close together for an hour each day. One family, who are friends, asked that our 10-year-old daughter keep away from this group. They are concerned that my wife, an emergency doctor on the front lines of this pandemic, increases the risk of exposure for our daughter — which increases the risk for their kids. These same friends have lawn signs that read: “Thank You, Healthcare Heroes!” Am I wrong to feel our friends have turned their backs on us?L.S.I wish I could be more sympathetic, but all of you are wrong! Despite your claim, you are not obeying your state’s shelter-in-place order. Neighborhood kids playing close together, even for an hour, is not safe, especially given the frequency of asymptomatic pediatric coronavirus cases.So, safety first! While the order is in place, keep your daughter indoors or supervise her when she’s outdoors. If she complains that other kids can play together, explain that keeping her safe is your most important job. Even after the state order is lifted, make sure you agree with your governor’s call. Have Covid-19 cases and deaths declined steadily in your area for several weeks, for instance?Then you and your neighbors can discuss the safety precautions your wife takes to protect herself and your family from contracting the virus. I’m sorry you’re hurt. But what makes your wife a hero is her willingness to assume greater risk of illness. How can you expect neighbors (even foolish ones who don’t practice social distancing) to overlook that? For now, organize play dates for your daughter on Zoom..Christoph NiemannBreaking the SilenceMy family was always close with our first cousins. About 20 years ago, they stopped all communication with us. We had no idea why. There was no fight. We went through the stages of a deep relationship redefining itself: perplexity, then anger, then resignation. My issue: I have a portrait of my aunt I would like to give to her oldest granddaughter. They were close. But I don’t want my cousins to think this is an attempt to renew our family relationship. There’s too much water under the bridge for that. Should I offer the painting?H.Now this is a welcome change: Normally, people ask me for permission to be mean, but you want to do something kind. You hesitate only because you worry your actions may undermine a feud you never understood. (I wonder: Did any of the “stages” of redefining your family relationship include calling a cousin and asking, “What gives?”)Families rarely act in lock step. I bet there was no vote by your cousins to ice you out. No, our most impulsive relatives act, and the rest of us tend to fall in line through inertia. Send the portrait to your cousin with a nice note about her closeness to her grandmother. If it’s true, add: “I’ve missed seeing you. I hope you’re well.”Take All the Victories You CanDuring our quarantine, a local group has organized a fun game of trivia every night on Zoom. My husband and I play as a team since we’re quarantined together. After we won a couple of nights in a row, a friend suggested we play individually to make it fairer. My husband was upset by this. Several couples play as teams. So, rather than break up the band, I’ve been throwing occasional questions to let others win. But it feels weird to be doing this. What do you think?T.P.Games are most fun when anyone can win. The exception: fan favorites on winning sprees, like the Chicago Bulls during Michael Jordan’s heyday. (Props to “The Last Dance” from the least likely viewer of a sports documentary ever!) There probably isn’t a huge fan base for your local Zoom trivia games, though.Stop playing with your husband if victory in inevitable. And stop losing intentionally. That’s just inevitability of a different stripe. Play on your own and tell your win-hungry husband to chill. Everyone deserves an honest shot at being the champ.Coins? Seriously?Why am I annoyed when friends pay to the penny for grocery items? During the pandemic, I’ve shopped for others (who have no need to count pennies). If they owe me $17.18, they give me $17 and one dime, one nickel and three pennies. I always round up to the next dollar. It bothers me when others don’t.o, coins annoy you. I can see that, I guess. But following your logic, isn’t a $10 bill plus a $5 bill plus two singles also kind of annoying? Wouldn’t a $20 bill be simpler — or a crisp $50?No, I suspect it’s the nit-picking accounting between friends that’s bothering you. Still, if this is your worst annoyance at a time when people are flagrantly flouting (and even protesting) sensible public health precautions, count yourself lucky."
10,2020-05-14,"In February, I left my husband after being married for 18 years. We were teen parents who managed to keep it together, and our three amazing kids are almost grown. We were a heck of team, but we put each other through too much. Now, add the coronavirus! Sometimes, I just want to go home to the safety of my husband and have our kids under one roof again. I can’t be sure how I would be doing if this virus hadn’t come along. But if I go back, I’m afraid I won’t be able to leave him twice. What should I do?A.Trust your judgment, not our grisly current circumstances. You weathered an 18-year marriage, so you’re probably not the impulsive type. If leaving your husband was the right call in February, don’t let the virus (alone) scare you back into a relationship that wasn’t working for you.I won’t sugarcoat it. These days, when even ordinary activities like grocery shopping can feel tinged with danger, starting a new life on your own may be too hard for you. (Don’t beat yourself up if it is!) But if you want to maintain the separation, start by reaching out to friends when you feel overwhelmed. Building a strong network of mutual support may be the key to this new chapter.I don’t want to push you. Maybe counseling can help salvage your marriage, even if that wasn’t your plan in February. You probably didn’t anticipate a pandemic back then. But hardship was always going to come along. Leaving your husband meant deciding to handle things differently. So, how do you want to honor that decision now?.Christoph NiemannRemember Me?Last year, I went on a couple of dates with a guy. I broke if off because I didn’t feel any chemistry. We hung out as friends a few times, but lost touch when we went back to university. Recently, I read an article about a well-known media company, and I recognized the C.E.O.’s unique surname as the same as the guy I dated. A little digging revealed they are father and son. I am trying to break into journalism, and a job at the C.E.O.’s company would be my dream. My friends say I absolutely cannot network with an ex. You? t first blush, I thought: You are a monster! But I quickly realized that I am, too — and so are most people looking for work. Give it a shot. The key is to avoid making this guy feel used. So, don’t try to puff up your fleeting romance. Own the fact that you are looking for a straight-up favor from a near-stranger you dumped.Text him a friendly message and tell him you saw an article about his media-mogul father. Then make the ask: “Would you be comfortable helping me arrange a call with someone at the company who works with young journalists?” Acknowledge that this may be too awkward for him and, if it is, you understand. If he doesn’t reply, let it go.Dad in TrainingMy boyfriend and I got a dog during the pandemic. With both of us working from home, we thought it would be a good time to train a puppy. But I’m bothered by the imbalance of labor involving the dog. I do 80 percent of the work! Would I be wrong to extrapolate this dynamic to child rearing? He wants kids. I’m leaning against them. I’m afraid his preference for video games and impatience with potty training would persist in parenthood. Is this a red flag I should run from? ell, it’s not an outstanding preview of coming attractions. But couples rarely fall into divisions of labor that feel great to both parties. It’s often a matter of discussion and fine-tuning. And those are great skills for any couple to practice.Together, make a list of daily chores related to the puppy: potty training, obedience exercises, regular walks, feeding and cuddling. Then divide it up with your boyfriend. If he’s a shirker (in allocation or in practice), point it out. Don’t be too rigid, though: An offer to clean the bathroom, for instance, would be worth several puppy walks to me.Is This Free or Not?During our lockdown, I’ve enjoyed seeing local musicians take to social media to perform for people stuck in their homes. Normally, we’d have to go to public venues and pay to hear them play. Many of the entertainers list PayPal or Venmo accounts on the bottom of the screen for people to donate to them. But I want to listen to the music without the guilt of paying to be entertained. Am I wrong?otally wrong! These musicians aren’t requiring you to pay them. So, if you can’t afford a few bucks (maybe you’ve lost your job) or if you like being a deadbeat, listen for free. But if you want me to take you off the hook for feeling guilty about stiffing hard-working artists who deserve to be paid for their music, please look elsewhere."
11,2020-05-21,"My guy and I have been seeing each other since August, and our relationship is going great. For the past two months, we’ve been sheltering in place together at his home (which is 90 minutes away from mine). We’ve been having lots of fun: great conversations, making art, listening to music and still getting our work done. My question: How do we address the transition when the pandemic ends, and we inevitably go back to our normal lives (and homes)? Essentially, we’ve gone on 62 dates in 62 days!ou and your boyfriend seem to have created a silver lining during an extremely stressful period. (I’m happy for you!) If your household is like mine, though, the good times required staying in the present moment rather than trying to predict our uncertain future: Will someone I love get sick? Will I lose my job? Am I stuck here forever?There are so many unknowns about what “normal” life will look like after the pandemic that I suggest postponing big decisions for now. Depending on where you live, for instance, you two may be sheltering in place for much of the summer. If one of you can keep working from home, that may eliminate a 90-minute barrier to living together. (Or when the time comes, you may not want that.)Stick with the here and now. Tomorrow is hazy. And I suspect you know that. Otherwise, after 60 days in lockdown, at least one of your “great conversations” would have touched on: “So, where is this relationship heading?”Keep deepening your knowledge of each other and sharing your feelings. That way, when you have a clearer glimpse of the future, you and your boyfriend can make wiser decisions that are rooted in reality. Or, as no one in “Casablanca” said: You’ll always have lockdown..Christoph Niemanns All DayThe parents and stepparent of our 11-year-old son have a disagreement. He is not currently attending school, of course, and spends most of his time indoors. His parents are content for him to spend entire days (when he doesn’t leave the house) in pajamas. His stepparent believes in maintaining a normal routine during the pandemic and asserts that pajamas reflect a lack of structure that will hamper his ability to grow into a responsible adult. Your thoughts?O.It is 2:26 p.m. as I write this, dressed in the same nightshirt I put on at 8 last night. Clearly I’m Team s. Insisting on “structure” for its own sake — here, for yet another day in isolation — is a pretty thin style-over-substance argument. There is no magic in pants. No, the value of structure comes when it’s tethered to otherwise productive activity.The bigger issue here is respecting a stepparent’s reasonable opinions about child rearing. Perhaps your son would enjoy a supervised daily walk (or bike ride) in the neighborhood? If so, changing into day wear would constitute structure that’s tied to a valuable change of pace: exercise and fresh air.No-Contact Delivery Next Time?My elderly mother lives in a small town in another state. She has severe mobility and health issues, and her regular helpers are scarce since the outbreak of Covid-19. The supermarket doesn’t deliver, but my mother called the store and explained her problem. A young woman there told her not to worry; she would deliver the groceries herself. And she did. The problem: My mother asked her to leave the bags at her door. But the woman insisted on bringing them inside, then hugged my mother (who was too polite to tell her to back off) and took a selfie of them, which she posted on Facebook. I’m torn. Can I be both grateful and angry?ou seem to be living proof that the combo is possible. But rather than parsing the kindness and cluelessness of strangers (who may not read this), let’s tackle your mother’s so-called politeness. You can do something about that.“Polite” is not a synonym for “passive.” Suggest a boundary-building response to her for the next time a delivery person seeks entry: “Thanks for your kindness! But for my safety and yours, please leave the bags outside.” Very polite!Hey, I’m Running Here!Since our stay-at-home order, I’ve had to change my running patterns. I now run past a residential garage at 7 a.m. Inside, an elderly couple smokes and runs a fan that blows cigarette smoke onto the sidewalk. I try to remember to run on the other side of the street, but I often forget. I think it’s outrageous that I’m forced to breathe in secondhand smoke! Should I write the couple a letter asking them to stop?ouldn’t it be easier to cross the street? Absent a law (or homeowner rule) that forbids smoking on the property, the couple is probably free to do so, and the inconvenience to you seems minor. Of course, I wish (for their sake and yours) that these people would abstain from smoking. But this is a stressful time and probably not the easiest one to kick a nicotine habit. I’d skip the letter for now."
12,2020-05-28,"I saw a post on my friend’s Instagram that infuriated me: a picture of seven boys in a row, their arms slung over each other’s shoulders, celebrating the 13th birthday of their friend (her son). Three boys wore face masks; four didn’t. We live in a state that recommends social distancing and face masks in public. I am sorry if this gets in the way of traditional birthday parties. My daughter will be extremely disappointed not to celebrate her summer birthday with friends in person. But we know these gatherings are not . I find this disrespectful to everyone who follows the rules and to our front-line workers. Should I confront my friend? Am I an idiot to be this furious?ou are not an idiot! (Though I recommend you stop killing time on social media.) Parties like these are risky for kids and the families to whom they return. But we may have reached a point in the pandemic when trying to reason with people who disagree with us is useless. Unless your friend has been living under a rock, she has likely made up her mind about masks and social distancing.The human toll of Covid-19 has been harrowing. It has also been scary to watch basic principles of public health be dismissed as overreaction, conspiracy or simply less important than birthday parties or haircuts. Many sensible people are making foolish choices. And many government entities have been weak: issuing toothless recommendations rather than lifesaving requirements.So, back to Instagram. If you think your friend may be open to a calm discussion about safety precautions at parties, go for it. But if just want to register your outrage, save your breath.Focus instead on keeping those you love safe and hunkering down for possibly greater turmoil as people so itchy to return to normal life jump the gun before it’s safe to do so. (And no more hate-scrolling on Instagram.).Christoph NiemannStaycationing in a PandemicI am married with a new baby, and I work at a small company. My husband and I haven’t had child care since February due to coronavirus restrictions. We’ve had no free time. We’re either working, sleeping or caring for our son. I had a big deadline at work last week. After I met it, I asked my boss for a few days off. He said it was a good idea, but now I’m sensing coldness toward me. Was I selfish to ask for time off when everyone could use a break?M.Please be kinder to yourself! You asked for time off, and your boss agreed. If he seems chilly, it’s probably because he is saving his charm for workers who will help him complete new tasks. That pool excludes you (for a few days). This is work; it’s not personal.And you’re entitled to your vacation. I suspect his transactional warmth will resume shining on you like the sun on the morning you report back for duty. Now, go and relax!Sick, but Not That Kind of SickMy husband is suffering from a serious illness that is not coronavirus related. With the dizzying round of diagnostic tests and doctors’ appointments, we are overwhelmed and exhausted. We are also confronting two other issues: telling friends we need some space and telling our son we need his attention. Any advice?t’s never a good time to be sick, of course. But I’m extra sorry that you and your husband have to deal with it now, during an all-consuming pandemic. Still, I predict that when you share your needs with friends and your son, most will come through for you. The trick is being clear and direct.When friends try to engage you, say: “We’re keeping a low profile for now. My husband is dealing with a health issue.” That should take care of it. But don’t be shy to ask for help or to ignore a few calls if some pals are slow to comprehend.The same goes for your son: Tell him exactly what you need, logistically and emotionally. It’s a common fantasy that loved ones will magically step up in times of crisis. But he may not know what you need until you tell him. I hope he delivers. If he doesn’t, move on. Now is the time for taking care of yourselves. Leave gripes for later.Time to Reconcile?I saw on Twitter that my ex-girlfriend posted about the death of a teacher who was a real mentor to her for years. I wanted to send my condolences, but I held back. We had a painful, drawn-out breakup, culminating in my asking her not to contact me. Did I make the right decision? (Tricky twist: I also have a book my ex lent me that is inscribed to her by this teacher.) respect your caution. But return the book with a warm note of condolence for your ex’s loss and a specific memory, if you have one, about this teacher’s importance to her. A selfless act of kindness nearly always trumps the angry turmoil of breakups from the past."
13,2020-06-04,"I ran into a friend in the lobby of our building. (I thought we were friends, anyway.) She is black; I am white. And protests over racist policing have been raging in our city. First, I made sure her teenage son was safe. I was worried after seeing news reports. (He’s fine.) Then I told her I was sad to see the protests turn violent, that I sincerely believe violence and hatred only beget more of the same. At that point, she rolled her eyes, said she envied me and walked away. Did I do something wrong?M.R.I know you meant well when you spoke to your friend. And you were kind to ask about her son. But I think it’s time for white people to stop handing out bromides on “violence and hatred” to people of color, as if we were in the same boat. We’re not. Your friend and her son are far more likely to face hatred and violence than you.For hundreds of years, the levers of society have pushed a harrowing portion of cruelty onto black people, especially in policing and criminal justice. As we reckon with this, yet again, in the wake of George Floyd’s death, let’s try to be the friends our communities of color deserve.The first thing is to get smarter. Read “The New Jim Crow,” by Michelle Alexander, or “Heavy,” by Kiese Laymon. White people can’t know the hardship of anti-black racism firsthand, but we can try to deepen our understanding of it without forcing our already burdened black friends to educate us.Even better, talk less and listen more. Black communities have lived the experience of inequality for generations. So, let’s be quiet and try to hear what people of color tell us they need. That may be the best way to become an ally who helps to achieve it. Apologize to your friend for being ham-handed. Then listen..Christoph NiemannUh, I Guess You Can Come In?My husband and I live in a coronavirus hot spot. We’ve been extremely careful. Recently, a relative stopped by our stoop to say hello. She brought a friend we’d never met. He asked if he could use our bathroom. Normally, I wouldn’t mind, but I didn’t feel comfortable. Still, I agreed because of social pressure. I gave him disinfecting wipes to use. Later, we cleaned the bathroom thoroughly and didn’t use it for a day. But I wish I had said no. Would that have been wrong?e gentler with yourself! Sure, under normal circumstances you might extend hospitality to a stranger. But these aren’t normal times. I’m less concerned about viral transmission than your punishing stress after letting this guy into your home: your safe space. Self-care is important. It may be hard for you, but next time, tell him you aren’t comfortable with his coming inside.When the Lease Is UpI recently moved out of my first apartment, parting ways with my roommate of one year. She thinks we’re best friends and intends to remain close. She is a kind person, and I wish her well, but I don’t consider her a friend. She has many traits I find frustrating: She is too dependent on me, and we lack interests in common. I was friendly while we lived together, but I no longer want her in my life. New York is so big it would be easy never to see her again. But another part of me wants to express myself and tell her I don’t want to be friends with her. What should I do? get your impulse to speak out. It seems to be tangled with some pent-up annoyance at your former roommate. But it would be cruel to tell her preemptively that you don’t want to be friends. She hasn’t asked for anything yet!Take a break. Tell her you’re busy settling your new place when she asks to hang out. (New Yorkers have the best excuse in the world right now: social distancing.) You may be surprised, though. After a healthy absence, a kind person who cares about you may sound pretty good.Gotta Get My KetoI am a 60-year-old man in great shape with a lean and muscular body. I have been sheltering in place with my younger girlfriend since March. We get along great. Since we’ve been together, she has adopted my ketogenic diet. The good news: She has gotten much leaner and looks amazing! The bad news: It’s getting harder to find enough keto friendly grass-fed beef, kimchi, macadamia nuts, pasture-raised eggs, organic greens and avocado oil at the supermarket. Because of Covid-19, I only shop once a week. How should I approach my girlfriend about not finding enough keto food for two?our gratuitous bragging — about your foxy body and younger girlfriend — and even longer shopping list do not make me terribly sympathetic with your plight. (Surprise!) Consider modesty the next time.For now, level with your girlfriend. Perhaps she can shop on a different day than you, after the market has been restocked, or she can explore shopping online. I hear young people are great with computers!"
14,2020-06-11,"Our 16-year-old son asked us if he could attend a Black Lives Matter protest march in our city, a Covid-19 hot spot. We said no. We decided it was too dangerous in terms of coronavirus risk and possible violence. He sneaked out of the apartment and went anyway. He claims he wore a mask and was socially distant the whole time, but we’re not sure whether to believe him or how to punish him. Any advice?his is a hard one! Your son is approaching adulthood, but until then you are responsible for his safety. Still, he didn’t sneak out to an opium den. He defied you to take part in one of the most pressing issues facing our nation: racist policing and criminal justice reform.I wish he’d worked harder to get your permission. And I hope you engaged him on the substance of the cause, even as you refused him. The fact that protesters are bravely risking both bodily harm and Covid-19 underscores the urgent need for change.Quiz your son about how he managed social distance in the jostle of a protest march and decide whether quarantine is appropriate. As for punishment, marry the necessity of respecting your house rules with the objectives of the rally. How about 50 hours of community service, volunteering for a group dedicated to economic or restorative justice?.Christoph NiemannThey Weren’t Supposed to Be in Our Quarantine PodI have a good relationship with my ex-husband as we continue raising our two teenagers. We divorced six years ago and share custody. I just learned he started seeing a new girlfriend in early March and that he stopped social distancing with her and her kids in May. He didn’t tell me! I believed our safety net was intact. I feel betrayed by my ex and my kids, whose father asked them not to tell me (to spare my feelings). But I’m upset about the virus and my elderly parents, not his love life. And as quickly as I learned of the betrayal, he asked me to include his girlfriend, her kids, her ex and whole world into mine. Thoughts?E.First, let yourself be angry! Your ex-husband sounds like a fiasco of a co-parent based on this episode. He lied to you; he asked your children to lie to you. And at a time when physical and emotional safety is precarious, he made a unilateral call that put you all in harm’s way.Our Covid-19 bubbles, the people we see without masks or social distancing, are bound to grow eventually. But expansion requires discussion and the agreement of everyone involved. No exceptions! And especially not one as lame as sparing your feelings over his new girlfriend after you’ve been divorced for six years. Isn’t it more likely your ex simply wanted his way?Now, onto cleanup: Use your good relationship to hash out his lapse in judgment calmly. Explain that transparency is vital. And work out exactly who makes up his and his girlfriend’s bubbles and what safety precautions they take.Then, all the adults can begin discussing logistics and possible isolation until everyone feels safe. Overlapping circles may make this process complex, but lives are at stake. (And steer clear of your elderly parents for a couple of weeks.)Estate PlanningYears ago, I was a Sunday school helper. I was especially fond of one little girl. I doted on her. Her mother gave me a framed scripture verse with the girl’s picture in it. I think she’s married now, but I lost track of her after we moved. On my death, I expect my children will throw away this gift. Still, it seems rude to return it to the girl’s mother. What should I do?M.A.T.The hard truth is that many possessions with sentimental value will be tossed out by our heirs when we die. That’s life! And I agree it would be odd to return the photo now, in anticipation of your future death. I might feel differently if the gift was unique, but the mother likely has a copy of this photo. Think of her gift as a gesture of thanks for your kindness, which you appreciated but may eventually discard.Maybe Cool It on the Pool Pics?One of my friends moved to a new house with a beautiful backyard pool. I am truly happy for her. But she posts pictures of her kids in the pool every day on Facebook and Instagram. My wife thinks these posts are insensitive during the pandemic when public pools are closed and many of us are struggling to occupy our kids. She thinks I should tell my friend that her followers may be reacting negatively. You?B.I’m surprised that you and your wife are old enough to have kids, but still haven’t worked out how to deal with friends whose harmless social media posts make you seethe with jealousy. Where have you been hiding? And who does your wife think she is? Just unfollow your friend on Facebook and mute her on Instagram. You won’t see her posts, your friend won’t know a thing and you can move on with your landlocked life."
15,2020-06-21,"Thanks to political correctness, I can no longer converse freely with my three adult children. I live in the South; they’ve scattered across the country. I think I’m a good person. No one has ever called me racist — except my children. When I was young, my parents hung a Confederate flag in our home. I remember it fondly because I remember them fondly. Recently, our town removed a Confederate statue from our cemetery. When I lament these changes, my children get furious with me. But it’s my opinion. I also believe black people deserve equal rights. Doesn’t freedom of speech exist anymore?reedom of speech lives! No one is stopping you from flying a Confederate flag on your private property or longing for one. Many people have taken them down, though, because fond memories of childhood (like yours) are dwarfed by the flag’s brutal history in the war against slavery and its celebration of legal racism.I suspect your children are frustrated with you for prioritizing fuzzy nostalgia over racial atrocity. They would probably like you to be more sensitive to the pain Confederate symbols can trigger in others. (That may also be why your town removed its Confederate statue from public land.)Now, pinning this conflict on “political correctness” implies that your children are being insincere or oversensitive. But how could routine encounters with such memorabilia not provoke stinging reminders, for many, about the cruelty of slavery and the continuing inequality of black Americans in so many arenas?A likelier reading, to me, is that you want the freedom to speak and also the freedom to silence other people’s reactions to what you’ve said. But that’s not how freedom works! No one is silencing you. Your kids are just asking you to focus on the bigger picture, beyond yourself and your childhood, with greater sensitivity to others..Christoph NiemannWhile We’re on the Subject of FlagsI love flags. We display a variety of them outside our suburban home: the American flag, the French flag on Bastille Day, the flag of Baltimore when the president trashed that city. This month, we have gay pride and transgender flags up. It’s my way of stating my beliefs. I would love to put up a Black Lives Matter flag, but as a white person, I want to be appropriately supportive and not an appropriator. Thoughts?M.Fly all your flags! You hang them in solidarity with people and causes you believe in. Saying that black lives matter, whether on a T-shirt, a flag or a tattoo, is a statement of support and totally appropriate for an ally. Appropriation would be claiming the experience of racial oppression as your own. That’s not what you’re doing here.Social Distancing, One Year InMy nephew and his fiancée were planning a big wedding in July. It was hard for them to give up the idea, but they decided to have a small backyard wedding on the original date and throw a big party next year. There will be 25 guests at the wedding and a dinner afterward. I know this has been stressful for them. When I jokingly asked if this would be a masked wedding, my nephew said they hadn’t thought about it. I don’t want to add to their stress, but my husband and I are at a higher risk of severe illness from the coronavirus. I don’t want to stand to the side during the ceremony and dinner. How should I ask about their social distancing plans?e direct. And knock off the jokes this time. (It sends a mixed message about your seriousness.) Stressed or not, being a responsible host these days requires a plan for masks and social distancing. If the bridal couple doesn’t have one a month before the wedding, or if their plan makes you uneasy, decline the invitation nicely.We’re all in different circumstances and have different comfort levels with safety precautions. (Personally, I don’t see myself at a gathering for 25 anytime soon, and I don’t apologize for that.) Prioritizing your health is sensible. Don’t negotiate, though. It’s not your party. Just clarify the hosts’ plans, then accept or refuse the invitation politely.Eco-Friendly Gift or No GiftI was invited to a friend’s baby shower that was canceled because of the pandemic. I’d like to send a gift, but I was disappointed to see her registry is full of conventional disposable diapers. I get that cloth diapers aren’t for everyone, but my friend can afford disposable diapers that are biodegradable. Would it be passive-aggressive to send eco-friendly disposable diapers, or should I buy something from the registry? (Honestly, the alternative is to send nothing. I am low-key outraged by people who ignore their basic moral responsibility to take care of our planet.)hoa! I was right with you until your outrage kicked in. Wouldn’t it be more effective to send a box of eco-friendly diapers with a nice note about why you prefer them? A first-time mother-to-be may not have given much thought to diapers. You’d be doing her (and our planet) a favor by explaining your position. And keep the righteousness to a minimum."
16,2020-06-25,"As the presidential election draws near, I would like to like to post a message on my Facebook timeline that says: “If any of my Facebook friends plan on voting for a particular candidate, I would appreciate your doing me the courtesy of unfriending me. I no longer want to be associated with people who share a worldview, political views or, most important, the same set of morals as this candidate. They are completely antithetical to mine.” My husband thinks I should not make this post. You?S.Is a friend who was kind to you — during a rough patch in college, say — any less kind because she supports a different candidate than you do? I would feel differently if she actually made offensive Facebook posts. But you’re trying to police people’s thoughts.Let’s go a step further: The best predictor (and reinforcer) of political views these days may be our media and social media diets. But our best hope for useful talks with people from seemingly unbridgeable political silos is that, once, in real life, we were good to each other. This makes me more hesitant to ask Facebook friends to scram.Your social media is yours, though. You may use it as you like. So, if you’re too exhausted, aggravated or hurt to interact with people who disagree with you, based on their choice of political candidate, you’re free to ask them to leave your Facebook page.If I were you, though, I’d take a break from Facebook instead. Come back when you’re ready to explore what connects you to the friends you now want to disown. Canceling people is easy. Reconnecting with them is hard, but it’s the only productive way forward. We need that now, even on the small scale of your Facebook page..Christoph NiemannBabies FirstMy twin sons were born two months premature. After three months in the neonatal I.C.U., we were finally able to bring them home. We’ve been practicing strict social distancing. My sister-in-law, who lives in another state, will soon be visiting my mother-in-law nearby. She’s asked if she can visit the twins, and I said sure, as long as she quarantines for 10 days and wears a mask. (She hasn’t been careful about coronavirus risks.) She freaked out and told me I was being ridiculous. The problem: She has mental health issues, and my husband and mother-in-law worry that the smallest thing may set her off. What should I do? ’m sorry for this extra stressor. But I may have a solution that avoids making your sister-in-law feel singled out. Once she sets foot in her mother’s home (presumably, without quarantining), insist that both of them wait for two weeks before they visit you and the twins.Let the quarantine be an experience of togetherness for your mother- and sister-in-law. And explain the need for masks and social distancing. (How can you possibly keep infants’ fingers out of their mouths?) Catering to the needs of others is great if you can manage it safely, but not at the expense of your fragile babies’ health.Put in a Good Word?I am a rising senior in college. This spring, I worked a remote internship along with taking classes. I had a great time! An acquaintance, whom I really dislike, has been texting me twice a week, asking me to put him in touch with my boss so he can get an internship too. I’ve tried dodging him, with little success. But I’m uncomfortable with this. I was only an intern! And even if could recommend someone, it wouldn’t be this guy. How do I say no, without letting him know I despise him?ventually, you may discover that there’s success enough for everyone, even (especially!) those we dislike. But you’re not there yet. (I wasn’t either in college.) For now, give your nemesis the company’s general email address.Tell him, as a former intern, you have little (if any) influence with your former boss and you intend to reserve it for yourself, so you won’t be recommending anyone. He may think you’re a selfish jerk, but there’s a value in learning to say no directly.Dog DaysMy financial situation hasn’t been affected by Covid-19 (yet), so I continued paying my dog walker during the pandemic even though he didn’t work. It seemed fair. Now that my city is reopening and dog walkers are permitted to work again, mine has decided not to return to the city. So, I decided not to pay him for June; it was his decision not to come back. My daughter thinks I should continue paying him until I find a replacement. You?J.Listen, it’s your money, and you’ve been generous with it. Why not continue the logic of pandemic payment to its natural end? Prorate payment for the month of June to the date your city allowed dog walkers to return. If your daughter wants to give your dog walker more, she can."
17,2020-11-07,"In light of recent events, my next-door neighbors apparently believe the police should be abolished. They placed a sign on their front porch that reads: “Defund the Police.” But we live in a neighborhood that has been vandalized in the past, and my neighbors are often away from home. Should I respect their wishes, as evidenced by the porch sign, and not call 911 if I see an act of vandalism in progress on their property?L.T.Here’s a wild idea: Why don’t you ask them? Many of the reports I’ve read about defunding the police focus on limiting the deployment of armed police officers to situations where they may be necessary and helpful — such as violent crimes.Many activists point to the large share of state and local budgets dedicated to police services when many calls to police (about persistent homelessness or family conflicts, for instance) would be better handled by social workers. Why not redirect some police funds to affordable housing and mental health services, they ask?Still others would like to dismantle the current model of policing, as Minneapolis has pledged to do, and reimagine community safety given the frequency with which officers kill unarmed Black men and women. To them, our police forces are existentially steeped in racism and excessive violence. Ongoing protests across the nation are calling for meaningful change.If you are concerned about this issue or disagree with your neighbors, approach them nicely to talk about it. But given “recent events,” as you call them (or more candidly, yet another spate of senseless killings by police), your neighbors may not want you to call 911 about vandals with spray paint. They may fear a disproportionate police response..Christoph NiemannSafety First?My husband works in a large hospital and has direct contact with Covid-19 patients. In the early days of the pandemic, I suggested he isolate outside the home we share with our 12-year-old son. Seeing the chaos in New York City made me question his ability to take the necessary safety precautions. Thankfully, his hospital was never overwhelmed. But he resents my attempts to “throw him out,” and I resent his lack of leadership in keeping our family safe. Should I have put family unity before safety?ou and your husband are wise to discuss your conflict openly. It would surely linger and darken your marriage if you hedged. I get the panic you felt at the outset of the pandemic with your husband in harm’s way. But he would probably feel less abandoned now if you had begun by asking for a jointly created whole-family approach to safety, rather than jumping straight to his moving out.Presumably, he was in a better position than you to know about the supply of P.P.E. at his hospital and the number of coronavirus cases there. What’s missing from your question, though, is why you believe he failed to protect you. Did he behave carelessly? Did he withhold information?My layman’s intuition is that you should begin with an apology for skipping several steps in your understandably fearful opening gambit. This will give him room (and validation) to consider the ways he may have behaved better, too. Don’t be shy about consulting a couples therapist, either. They can be tremendously helpful.Please Stop ‘Thinking’ of MeI had a miscarriage during my second trimester of pregnancy in 2016. The grief is fossilized in my heart. I don’t remember the exact date, but it was after Mother’s Day. I have no interest in commemorating this loss. But every year, my sister-in-law texts me some platitude, like “Thinking of you.” I reply with a terse thank you, hoping she will take the hint. But she doesn’t. How can she not see that her texts may be triggering? Also, how does she remember the date? Has she set a Google calendar alarm for my pain? am truly sorry for your loss. But your anger at your sister-in-law for messages that are clearly intended as supportive seems misplaced to me. I have learned, generally, that people are terrible mind readers. Stop hinting!When you next see her, say: “I know you’re trying to be kind by remembering my miscarriage, but it’s not an occasion I want to memorialize. Please stop sending messages about it. They hurt me.” (And if you can’t bear to say it, text her.)Yardwork, InterruptedTwo young brothers race their bikes on our cul-de-sac and come to a skidding stop at the end of our driveway. This drives my husband crazy! He has to re-rake our gravel every time. He wants to bury planks of wood with nails protruding from them to deter the boys. I’m having a hard time convincing him why he shouldn’t. Help!G.E.Why? Because it is monstrous to put children’s safety (and your car tires) at risk this way. Just call the boys’ parents and report the problem. There, solved! As for your husband, tell him there is a bright red line between cranky and sociopathic. He is on the wrong side of it here. "
18,2020-07-17,"I have a question that I hope you won’t take the wrong way. I am 72 years old and have been isolating for months. I take Covid-19 very seriously. But I’ve noticed a double standard about safety measures: People who refuse to wear face masks on principle, as a statement of their personal freedom, are shamed about it (often on the internet). But protesters in the Black Lives Matter movement seem to get a free pass on not wearing them. People get agitated when I bring this up. Am I wrong to?t’s never wrong to make an honest observation. But it’s also important to notice where our vision may be blinkered. I suspect people are reluctant to equate the two groups and aren’t quite sure you’re describing a “double standard” — where different rules are applied to situations that are essentially the same.There’s only one rule: We should all wear masks in public. They’re recommended by medical experts and mandated by many states to slow the spread of a contagious virus. This rule applies equally to supporters of personal freedom and Black Lives Matter protesters. (A crucial note: Wearing masks protects others from us better than it protects us from others. That’s why we all need them.)But the groups’ enterprises could not be more different. Those who reject face masks as an undue infringement on their liberty make a perverse, nonsensical argument. Our Bill of Rights grants no freedom to spread disease. And the mask refusers would probably be publicly shamed less often if they stopped screaming at polite checkout clerks.The protesters, on the other hand, have taken to the streets in anger and grief over inhumane treatment of Black people. Most wear masks; some do not, which is a shame. (But there’s no evidence that the protests have led to a spike in coronavirus cases.) The value of their project, though, rooted in civil rights, dwarfs the selfish refusal to wear masks on principle. The situations are utterly different. So, “double standard” is the wrong complaint. Still, I agree: We should all cover our faces in public!.Christoph NiemannUse It WellOccasionally, I give substantial amounts of money to my three married children without specifying how it is to be used. Two of them are careful in how they spend it, and their choices reflect the values with which they were raised. The third is married to someone who values luxury items. I am reluctant to interfere in my children’s lives, but I don’t want my money to be used frivolously. How should I handle this?’m confused. Other than Zoom yoga classes and expensive organic produce, what is there to spend money on these days? You don’t mention any of the children being economically harmed by the pandemic. That’s lucky! Still, it’s your money, so you can be as controlling (and Puritan) about it as you like. I don’t recommend it, though.The best approach is to treat siblings the same. Parental gifts can feel like proxies for affection, and different treatment can sting. Either limit their use of your money to preapproved categories, such as college funds and real estate, or let them spend it as they choose. Is a luxury among self-supporting adults such a terrible thing?Outdoor Gathering, Indoor BathroomMy husband began participating in a socially distanced guys’ night held outdoors: Bring your own chair and beverage, go home when you need to pee. But I learned from my friend, whose husband was the host, that my husband went inside to use the bathroom. This is not what we agreed on! He claims he was on his way to a tree when the host told him he could use the bathroom. Thoughts?et’s hope he does better next time. We’re all figuring out re-engagement on the fly. The host may have felt awkward barring guests from his bathroom, even though that was the agreed-upon protocol. So, he made a spontaneous offer that your husband felt uncomfortable refusing. Next time, suggest he reply: “Thanks, but let’s stick with our plan.” Or have him come home to use the bathroom indoors like a normal person.Sisters? You’ve Got to Be Kidding MeWhen I’m out to lunch with my mum, men often ask: “Are you two sisters?” I know they mean it as a compliment to her, but I find it demeaning. My mum is a vibrant, intelligent woman, but she doesn’t look like my sister. And I don’t think she should be aspiring to look 25 years younger than she is. How can I let these men know their question is inappropriate?C.P.I hate to be difficult, but I’m pretty sure these men are cracking a corny joke. (It’s the oldest line in the book!) Sure, it betrays their assessment of your mother as an object, which is gross, but you’re probably the only one taking it literally.Before you say anything, make sure your mother agrees with you. (She is their target after all, right?) If she does, reply: “Yes, we’re sisters, which makes you old enough to be our father. Creepy!” But if she prefers to chat with these gents for a while, let her. You can buy her the feminist canon for her birthday."
19,2020-07-16,"My 24-year-old son and I bicker constantly over politics. He thinks I’m hypnotized by Fox News. I’m not, but I’m not impressed by his knee-jerk liberal positions either. I never doubted our love for each other. But when Covid-19 came, he began accusing his stepfather and me of not taking the virus seriously. (We’ve always followed our state’s mandates.) Now, my husband has become seriously ill with the virus. And my son has been nasty about it: blaming us and saying, “I told you so,” rather than helping me or being sympathetic. I am devastated. What can I do? I’m sorry for your troubles: both your husband’s illness and your son’s inability to rise above the politics of a virus that never should have been politicized in the first place. Let me suggest an approach that may be helpful to you now and ignores partisanship (at least temporarily).At 24, your son is still very young. He may benefit from some last-ditch parenting. If you have the energy, tell him: “Honey, we can fight later. But right now, I am hurting and scared. I need help from you and kindness.” He may snap into shape, whether that means running errands for you or checking in with solicitous calls.If your son can’t put aside his anger (or possibly, his fear of losing you), put him aside for now, as hard as that may be. Focus on taking care of yourself and your husband. If there are others you can ask for support, call them. You can go back to your son later, but don’t invest more scarce energy in this conflict now. And please be safe! This is a harrowing health crisis. Still, many government officials have minimized its danger and provided mixed messages about how to protect ourselves. That is not your fault. And from here on, follow the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the doctors treating your husband. I wish your family the best of luck..Christoph NiemannNeighbor to NeighborWe relocated to our second home in a rural area. My daughter visited and noticed a Black lawn jockey statue on our elderly neighbor’s lawn. My daughter was offended and, frankly, so are we. But the neighbor is a friend. I don’t know if she placed it there originally or if she even understands its significance. Any ideas for handling this?ot take: Many of us have taken to internet shaming and social media blocking like fish to water. It’s easy, but accomplishes little. At the same time, we studiously avoid briefly awkward, civil conversations with friends, though they can actually make a big difference.You like the woman next door! Go to her and say: “We love having you for a neighbor. Would you consider removing the lawn jockey from your property? It’s a racist caricature, and we hate to see it.” She may refuse; it’s private property. But if you’re not even willing to ask, how much does that lawn jockey really bother you?Should I Stay or Should I Go?I am subletting an apartment in New York. The contract with my roommate provides that I can leave after 30 days’ notice. But we made an oral agreement that I would stay until the end of the year. The pandemic has changed my situation, though. I am working remotely until 2021 and have moved back to my parents’ home. I know the rental market is bad, and if I leave, my roommate may be unable to rent my room. (Also, he probably can’t afford the whole rent himself.) My parents think I have a moral obligation to remain in the sublease. I’m not so sure. You? our signature suggests you already know the answer to your question. Let’s put aside the enforceability of your oral agreement; you haven’t provided any details. I assume you don’t pay rent to your parents, and your salary has remained the same. So, paying your roommate, as agreed, leaves you in a neutral position.Here’s a solution that may work for both of you: Tell your roommate that you’re leaving the apartment, but you will continue paying rent through December — unless he replaces you sooner. You can even help him look for your replacement! Your decency may inspire him to act as diligently as safety allows.The Venmo-ization of HospitalityI have hosted a friend for dinner four or five times. I cook and encourage guests to bring beverages of their choice. This friend has long made a point of wanting to reciprocate once she moved into a larger apartment. Finally, she did and invited us to dinner. We went, and she sent a Venmo request for payment the next day. I don’t want to be petty, but I am outraged. Help!wo choices: Ignore her ridiculous Venmo request. Or thank her for it and tell her you will credit her bill against the much larger tab she has run up at your place. (Then drop the matter; this is not worth tangling over.) Hosts can make whatever kind of invitation they like, but the terms must be clear beforehand."
20,2020-07-23,"My husband, 8-year-old son and I live in a city that has become a Covid-19 hot spot. From the beginning of the pandemic, even when infections were low in our area, my son was fearful of the virus. He’s a little withdrawn (though happy to play with friends on Zoom) and worries that precautions like masks and social distancing are not enough to keep us safe. The problem: My husband just tested positive for the virus, but he has no symptoms; my son and I tested negative. Should we tell our son the truth or fib and say his dad is traveling for work while he quarantines at his parents’ house?on’t lie to your son. I get trying to spare him from worry, but he sounds worried already and sensitive to the dangers of the virus. He would likely be skeptical of a two-week business trip during a pandemic. (He’s a child, not an idiot.) And if he discovers he can’t trust you, he may become even more apprehensive.Use this opportunity to explore his feelings. Help your son find the words to express his fears. And don’t be too quick to reassure him. Ask questions. Let him get it all out! Then validate his concerns, tell him your top job is keeping him healthy and, together, make a safety plan. Be patient if you have to repeat this drill.As for telling your son about his father, stick with the facts and reasonable optimism. “Daddy has the virus, but he feels great. He’s going to stay in his room (or at Grandma’s house) for two weeks, and we won’t go in there, to make sure he gets better and we don’t get sick.” If your son needs more assurance, let him speak to his pediatrician or a therapist. And make sure he sees his dad as much as he wants on Zoom..Christoph NiemannAbout Dad’s Journals …When my mother died, she divided her estate equally between my brother and me. She specifically assigned valuable items but didn’t mention my father’s journals. (He died 25 years ago.) I took them with me before I sold my share of the house to my brother. They convey how anxiety-ridden and depressed he was. Now, my brother has asked to see them, but I am reluctant to hand them over. My brother has struggled with depression, and I fear his reaction to them. He is also disorganized. His house is a shambles, and he often forgets to pay bills. I would be crushed if the journals disappeared. What should I do? applaud your protective instinct, but not your controlling one. You and your brother likely share ownership of the journals. So, he has every right to see them. People with depression are not generally restricted to cheerful reading material. Better understanding your family history of mental illness may even be useful to your brother.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated Oct. 14, 2021, 1:05 p.m. iden calls on businesses to ‘step up’ as he expresses optimism about the fight against the virus.Here’s the expert panel that will vote on Moderna and J.& J. booster shots.Six out of seven coronavirus cases in Africa are going undetected, the W.H.O. says.Warn him that the journals are upsetting and reflect your father’s anxiety and depression. It’s your brother’s call whether to read them. And his lousy housekeeping and possibly poor credit score do not give you special rights here. Just ask him to be careful with the journals. BoomersI recently graduated from college. I’m living with my parents and working from home. I’ve decided to move back to New York, where I went to school, because I’m craving independence and the rents are relatively cheap. But now, when I ask my parents to wear masks in stores or not to invite friends inside their home, they say “You’re one to talk!” because I’m moving to a supposedly dangerous city instead of staying with them. Do they have a point?o. If your parents reject wearing masks in public and invite friends into their home during a worsening pandemic, I suspect you may be better off in an apartment where all of the occupants observe sensible safety precautions — indoors and out.What’s more, using New York, which is keeping its infection rate low, as a boogeyman to rationalize their reckless behavior is a terrible argument. Remind them patiently about masks, social distancing and hand washing. Then pack your bags and move!Just FriendsI am a 70-year-old woman. I date men when I can find one who works out, which isn’t often. So women friends are important to me. But I never seem to have enough of them. When I meet an interesting woman and invite her to do something, I would like to clarify that I’m looking for friendship, not romance. Would that be odd?S.M.Extremely odd! In just a few lines, you suggest that women friends are like consolation prizes for not having a man in your life. (Not true, in my experience!) I hope the reason you need more friends is not because you drop the ones you have as soon as a man comes knocking.And establishing preemptively that you’re looking for friendship, not sex, when you first invite a relative stranger to lunch or for a walk in the park, may be awkward and off-putting, not to mention homophobic. Don’t do it. Just let your friendly invitation speak for itself."
21,2020-07-30,"I live in a small city that’s in the process of reopening as new Covid-19 cases remain relatively low. This is wonderful! Still, it frightens me to see people in stores and on buses, for instance, who are not wearing face masks as required by my state. I would never subject another person to the virus, even accidentally, if I didn’t know I was infected or have any symptoms! Do you have a script for asking strangers to put on their masks?M.M.I wanted to road-test a script before suggesting one, so I tried my luck with three strangers who were violating New York’s mandate to wear masks indoors and when social distancing is difficult outdoors. I struck out every time! This surprised me. It also made me feel angry and helpless, even though most people I saw were wearing masks.The first person I asked was a fellow shopper at the market. “Can you put on a mask, please?” I said, extra friendly. He ignored me, so I asked again. “I’m good,” he said. This annoyed me. “You’re good because I’m wearing a mask,” I told him. “Why not return the favor?” He glared, and I moved on. There is no upside in a screaming match with a person without a mask. Hello, viral droplets!The next day, I was in the dog park, where playful dogs can often bring owners within six feet of each other. I pulled down my mask briefly, to smile and ask a woman nearby to put on a mask. “We’re outdoors,” she said. “But our dogs bring us close,” I replied. I even offered her a mask. She suggested I leave if I didn’t feel safe.My final attempt was at the post office, where I tried a firmer tone with a man who pointed to a mask dangling beneath his chin, as if that should appease me. “Please pull it up,” I said. “It’s the law.” But he refused. “I won’t be long,” he said.Now, you may have better luck than I did. But I’m not optimistic. No one screamed at me, like in the nasty videos I see online, but no one cooperated either. So, ask away.But it may be more productive to report mask-less patrons to store managers or bus drivers when possible. (They have more authority to enforce the rules.) Or save your energy for trying to keep your distance from selfish people without masks..Christoph NiemannThat Was an Heirloom!My grandson dated a woman for five years. After three years, I asked him if it was serious. He said it was. For Christmas that year, I gave her an aquamarine necklace that belonged to my mother. I continued giving her heirloom pieces for the next two holidays. Then they broke up, to my surprise. I asked my grandson to retrieve our family heirlooms, but his ex-girlfriend refused to return them. What can I do?’m sorry you mistook a “serious” relationship for one that was permanent (or might yield great-granddaughters). That doesn’t always happen, as you now know. The ex is under no obligation, other than a sympathetic one, to return gifts that were freely given to her. Givers retain no ownership in gifts.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated Oct. 14, 2021, 1:05 p.m. iden calls on businesses to ‘step up’ as he expresses optimism about the fight against the virus.Here’s the expert panel that will vote on Moderna and J.& J. booster shots.Six out of seven coronavirus cases in Africa are going undetected, the W.H.O. says.But perhaps a call from you to the ex about the sentimental value of the jewelry may help? When something similar happened in my family, my mother agreed to buy back the heirlooms. (She was furious about it, but she did it.) Is that possible? And next time, think twice before handing over a tiara you intend to take back if circumstances change.No Longer Estranged, but Still DistantMy brother and I were estranged for 15 years. The pandemic helped us break through our silence. Now, he has invited me to his 60th birthday party in September, which would require a six-hour flight. Obviously, I’m not getting on a plane now. How can I preserve our relationship? (He’s sensitive.)’m sorry the pandemic threw a wrench into your reconciliation with your brother. Call him and say: “I’m so happy we’re talking again! I missed you. If there was anyone I would get on a six-hour flight for, it’s you. But I can’t do that safely now. I hope you’ll understand.” Then send him a thoughtful gift, cross your fingers and keep talking. It’s not as if you have a sensible alternative, right?Sign Our Petition?For the last four years, since I was 9, I went to summer camp with my older brother in August. We love it. This year, after making many rules about masks and social distancing, our camp announced it would reopen. But my parents aren’t letting us go. They don’t think it’s safe. Can we add your name to the list of people protesting our parents’ decision?ermission denied, camper! I’m sorry you’re disappointed. But I suspect the low adult-to-kid ratio at camp would put too much pressure on you to behave responsibly all the time. (And if my math is correct, you’re only 13 or 14.) Instead, use the leverage of your parents’ guilt to persuade them to buy you some nice swag or adopt a dog."
22,2020-08-06,"I am one of the many women who now find our name used as an insult or shorthand for an obnoxious, entitled, occasionally racist creature who demands to speak to the manager or calls the police for no good reason. I know this is not the biggest problem. But it really hurts me, especially since I try not to exhibit the behaviors associated with the insult. How should I respond when I hear someone being called “a Karen”? Ignore it, defend myself or change my name?ou are in excellent company! I have a flurry of letters from women named Karen whose feelings are really hurt. I confess I’m flummoxed by the depth of emotion. Sure, your name has been hijacked. But the insult isn’t aimed at you specifically. According to census data, there are more than a million Karens in the country!It’s not personal at all, unlike the recent misogynistic attack on a congresswoman by her male colleague, or the racist slurs and dog whistles applied to Black Lives Matter protesters. Those are instances of direct abuse.Now, I object to the sexism of the meme. It’s no coincidence that Karen’s male counterpart, Ken, never really caught on. (An angry white man is just a man.) And I hate to think of you feeling bad. So, the next time you hear the insult, say: “I know it’s catchy, but it hurts my feelings. Can’t you call out the bad behavior without using my name?” Keep in mind: Memes fade fast. Remember Becky?Vacation? Now?My elderly mother has cancer. She went to the emergency room after a fall and tested positive for coronavirus. My sister, who was exposed to my mom while she was positive, is isolating and waiting for a negative test result so she can go on a family vacation. I told her she should skip her vacation and stay with our mother when she is released from the hospital. She expects me to drive eight hours to mom’s house, then quarantine away from my family afterward. I told my sister she is sacrificing my family for her vacation. She disagrees. How can I persuade her she is being selfish?A.You don’t seem measurably less selfish than your sister, so I fear you will not persuade her. Unless the initial plan was to leave your mother (with cancer and prone to falls) alone during your sister’s vacation, you were always going to drive to her house to take care of her. The only change is her coronavirus diagnosis.I doubt the hospital will release a geriatric Covid patient, especially one with cancer, while she is sick with the virus. (She may also need rehabilitation after her fall.) If I’m wrong, please don’t expose yourself to undue risk! But your mother’s diagnosis argues for fuller discussion with her, your sister and the doctor; it doesn’t take you off the hook for shared responsibility for her care..Christoph NiemannRent Relief, at a CostI have shared an apartment with my roommate for three years. We get along well. In December, she went to China for three months. So, we invited a mutual friend to stay in our guest room and help with the rent. When my roommate returned, the pandemic was on, and it didn’t feel right to ask our friend to leave. Also, my roommate is a yoga teacher, and her income is reduced. She says she can’t afford to pay her full share of the rent now, so having our friend here is helpful. The problem: I can’t stand living with this friend anymore! What should I do?he easiest solution (unfortunately) requires your forbearance: Ask your friend to stop doing whatever it is that bugs you. During this period of economic turmoil, your friend allows you and your roommate, with her reduced income, to stay in place.If that’s not feasible, talk to your roommate about finding a different person to rent the spare room. Or set a reasonable deadline for your roommate to begin paying half the rent again. Depending on your lease, this may be the toughest route: You may be jointly responsible for the entire rent, and it may be hard for your roommate to increase her income now.Just FriendsOver the last year, I became close friends with another man. Recently, things shifted. He invited me to spend the night with him several times in the last month. I did. Nothing sexual happened; we just spooned all night. I took this as a sign of romantic interest. But two days ago, he announced he has a boyfriend, whom he never mentioned before. He claims he often spoons with friends. Am I wrong to feel blindsided and used?t seems odd that a close friend never mentioned his boyfriend. But platonic spooning all night seems odd to me, too, especially in the midst of a pandemic. Next time, use your words. If a situation feels weird, ask what’s going on, ?"
23,2020-08-13,"I am a young Black woman who’s been quarantining with my white boyfriend for months. It’s been mostly great for us as a couple. When we visit his family nearby, they often ask me about the Black Lives Matter protests, in which we’re participating. I find them genuinely interested, respectful and curious about why expressions like “All Lives Matter” are racist. I’m happy to engage. But my boyfriend gets furious with them! He turns simple questions into big fights. What am I missing? love your willingness to talk about race with people who may not have considered it much before our current reckoning, in the wake of George Floyd’s horrible death. But I’ve received many letters from readers of color who feel legitimately burdened by their white friends’ newfound and seemingly insatiable interest in racism.Your boyfriend may feel protective of you or embarrassed that his family is treating you like an expert witness on Blackness. They could do some work too, right? A simple Google search would explain how the phrase “All Lives Matter” robs the protests against anti-Black racism of the specific point. It’s not your job to educate this family.Still, I bet you’re having a big influence on them. Thanks to you, they may develop a deeper sensitivity and, in fairness, it’s only recently that many white people have been willing to acknowledge that a “colorblind” approach to racism (treating everyone the same despite our long history of inequality) only further entrenches the problem.As for your boyfriend’s anger, tell him you’re happy, for now, to invest this energy in his family because you love him and want to help them know you better. And promise you’ll let him know when you tire of being their great Black resource. (And make sure you do!)Childcare CameosMy colleagues and I are working remotely during the pandemic. Our boss has an 8-years-old daughter who delights in making daily appearances in our Zoom meetings. She holds up handmade signs for us to read or climbs onto her mother’s lap and waves at the camera while her mother runs our meetings. I feel pressure to delight in her supposed adorableness. I understand the hardships working parents face now. But most of the people in these meetings have young children who do not make cameos. I find our boss’s child hard to take. Any suggestions?f course I have suggestions! That’s my job. And incidentally, those suggestions must be broadly acceptable to my boss, or I’d be fired. It’s called working for a company. Here, I suggest holding your fire about your boss’s kid. Not every grievance needs to be aired, especially not petty ones involving our superiors at work.Let the little girl have her 30 seconds of attention. It’s probably inappropriate, as you suggest. But letting this slide means that when you have a serious issue to bring to your boss, she won’t see you as the whiner who shut down her daughter’s harmless fun. Consider muting Zoom, averting your face and shouting into a pillow, instead..Christoph NiemannBlame ShameMy wife and I are an older couple. We were terrified of Covid-19 and very careful about masks, social distancing and staying at home when possible. Still, I got the virus anyway. I didn’t have to be hospitalized, and my wife was fine. We quarantined at home. I have no issue talking about our experience, but my wife doesn’t want me to. She believes people will think less of us, that we were careless about the pandemic. You?t breaks my heart that on top of the fear and illness you’ve already suffered, your wife is now grappling with shame. Neither of you is to blame for getting sick. The novel coronavirus is highly contagious, and it sounds as if you took reasonable precautions.Sadly, victim-blaming and shame over illness are nothing new. Read Susan Sontag’s essay, “Illness as a Metaphor,” for a deeper dive. I can’t tell you and your wife what to do. But let me float an idea: By showing your friends the responsible face of Covid patients (yours!), you may encourage extra vigilance in them. A great result!Present CompanyMore than once, at different people’s homes, I have been served chocolates or wine I gave as host gifts months or even a year before. I know that once given, a gift is no longer under my control. But I feel rejected when this happens, as if my gifts weren’t worth consuming or serving to other guests. Am I oversensitive, or are my hosts being rude?et’s wheel back to the bigger picture. Host gifts are tokens of thanks for often larger gestures of hospitality, like feeding us dinner or inviting us for the weekend. The circuit is complete when the gift is made and the visit ends. Why inject a note of pettiness about the gifts’ use? Maybe your hosts don’t care for the chocolates or wine you brought. No crime there! Isn’t it doubly thoughtful of them to remember that you do?"
24,2020-08-20,"Every year, I send my adult daughter a check for her birthday and Christmas. She told me she prefers cash to other gifts. But she never, ever acknowledges them or thanks me. This has been going on for years! I only know if she gets them by checking my bank account. I asked her to text me a few years ago. It helped for a while, then she stopped. I’m on a tight budget, so these checks are a sacrifice. And her silence hurts me. Should I stop sending the checks if she can’t be bothered to thank me? Or maybe just send a card? I don’t want to irritate her, but I raised her better than this.or years, every week has brought at least one new variation on this letter. Its central question is by far the one I hear most often. I’ve answered it a few times: We give gifts out of love, not to be thanked; speak up gently; if this really bothers you, stop sending gifts. But I’ve never gotten to the root of the problem. Why does this happen?My new theory: If a parent (or uncle or grandmother) sends a gift, year after year, without any acknowledgment from the recipient, maybe the recipient doesn’t experience it as a gift. Maybe your daughter and the others see these presents as their entitlement, like stock dividends or Social Security checks. The fact that the gifts keep coming, without further action, supports their belief.Talk to your daughter again. Highlight the voluntary nature of the checks. (And skip the guilt trip about how you raised her.) Tell her you’re glad to make room for gifts in your budget because you love her. But her failure to thank you hurts your feelings. Then ask her to be more thoughtful. If she still can’t, trade the checks for greeting cards..Christoph NiemannSecret Gym? I’m Calling the Covid PoliceMy husband and I go to the dog park most evenings. While there, a woman we’re friendly with confided that her gym had secretly reopened. (Gyms aren’t permitted to reopen in our state yet.) She was trying to help the owner by spreading the word to people she trusts. She said the owner had darkened the gym’s windows and hired a “lookout” for the front door. She also said no one worries about masks or social distancing there. I want to report the gym. Our hospitals are overwhelmed. But my husband thinks I should let it go to preserve our friendship with this woman. You?iolations of coronavirus regulations are not victimless crimes. The gym owner and those using the clandestine facilities are likely contributing to community spread of the virus, endangering essential workers and placing further strain on local hospitals. Your friend’s misjudgment of your character is her problem, not yours.You don’t mention how you responded to her invitation. Be direct: “We follow state and federal safety guidelines. That’s the only way we’re going to get this pandemic under control.” If she’s really a friend, you may influence her behavior. If she’s just a woman from the dog park, you probably won’t.Still, focusing on one scofflaw from this secret gym seems inadequate. Call the police and report the illegal operation (anonymously, if you prefer). How many fellow citizens are you willing to see infected thanks to people selfishly prioritizing squat machines over human lives?How to Thank a Pandemic HeroMy sister and I haven’t been able to see our elderly parents since February. We live out of state and have been doing what we can for them remotely. But their next-door neighbors have been invaluable, picking up prescriptions, checking on them (from the sidewalk) and buying groceries in between deliveries. How do we thank them? Verbal thanks feel inadequate, and sending money seems dismissive.hat a terrific story! Frankly, when the pandemic first hit, I expected to hear more of them and far less about ugliness in Costco over masks. Your letter is a nice reminder that just because we don’t hear about kindness doesn’t mean it’s not there.Start with a letter. Let the neighbors know how much their generosity has meant to you. Then grill your parents: Did the neighbors lose work during the pandemic? Do they have any hobbies? Depending on their circumstances (and yours), send as big a gift card or check as you can manage. (Cash gifts are often frowned upon, but I suspect they’d be welcome now by anyone struggling to buy food or pay rent.)I’ll Make the Bed, but the Toilet? Really?My husband and I are annual houseguests at our friend’s vacation home. When we leave, I change the sheets and make sure the bathroom is clean. Last year, our host handed me a bottle of toilet-bowl cleaner and asked me to clean the toilet. I was taken aback but did it. If she asks again this year, should I let it slide or say something?T.B.It depends. If you purchased the full-service houseguest plan, I would definitely speak up. But if your friend has kindly invited you to stay with her at her vacation home for free, and this is her big ask, get scrubbing!"
25,2020-08-27,"As a teen, TikTok creates stress in my life. When I hang out with friends, they often ask if I want to make a TikTok with them. I never suggest it, but it nearly always comes up. I want to be nice and say yes, but then I worry that other friends will see the clip and feel excluded that they weren’t part of it. At times, TikToks have made me feel separate from my friends, and I don’t want to make anyone else feel that. How can I be polite and still respect my friends’ feelings?M.You sound like an exceedingly kind person. It’s not always the case that someone takes a hurtful experience — say, being excluded from friends’ TikToks — and resolves not to hurt others the same way. I believe that your empathy will serve you well.Let me suggest two ways to approach your friends. If you really don’t enjoy dreaming up concepts for clips, filming them and sharing them on social media, just say, “Let’s do something else. I need a breather from TikTok.” You may be surprised that others agree. Sometimes posting can feel like pressure.But if the only thing stopping you is your fear of hurting absent friends, why not include a few when you hang out? Or invite others to make TikToks with you later? We can’t all be invited to everything. And much of social life is an accident: being in the right place at the right time. Better to expand the pool of people who are in those places than reject fun opportunities when they arise. (And never stop being so thoughtful!).Christoph NiemannBabe, Are You Trying to Kill Me?My boyfriend flew to Tulum for a vacation. I refused to go because I didn’t think it was safe. I have an autoimmune disease that puts me at greater risk for developing severe symptoms of Covid-19. Now, I see pictures of my boyfriend going to parties in Tulum, getting spa treatments and not wearing a mask. He won’t commit to getting tested the day he returns. In March, he was the one panicking! How do I get him to understand that his behavior is potentially dangerous for my health? don’t want to go overboard. You haven’t said how serious your relationship is or how you expressed your concerns to your boyfriend. Still, saying “I see red flags here” is a big understatement. This guy is prioritizing a good (and seemingly reckless) time in Mexico over his and your well-being.A medical note: You are placing too much faith in testing on the day your boyfriend returns from vacation. Testing is important, but there may be a lag between infection with the virus and testing positive for Covid-19. The only safe alternative is for him to quarantine for a period. Many states recommend 14 days.Now, six months into this pandemic, your question isn’t rocket science. If your boyfriend refuses to wear a mask or observe social distancing and other sensible safety precautions, consider making his post-vacation quarantine a permanent one. Why would you want a boyfriend who doesn’t care about keeping you or himself safe?Not the TherapistI recently reconnected with a person from my past on whom I am now developing a major crush. The feeling is mutual, which is great. But the other day, we discovered that we share a much-loved therapist. I’ve always wanted to date an evolved person who goes to a therapist — just not mine! I also get the sense that neither of us wants to find a new therapist. Help!rushes are mostly fantasy — and fun! But there’s a long road between a crush, however “major,” and a relationship that’s likely to cause your therapist ethical problems or you and your friend discomfort. For now, just enjoy getting to know each other again.Sure, tell your therapist about the crush. But why borrow trouble? If this spark of interest develops into a romance — or if you, your friend or the therapist feel uncomfortable — your therapist can help one or both of you find new therapists. Your focus on therapy, though, instead of the relationship, suggests this may be a ways off.To Give, or Not to GiveWe received an evite to a virtual wedding. We weren’t on the guest list for the original wedding (in real life) which was canceled as result of the coronavirus pandemic. That was fine with us because we’re only casual friends of the groom’s parents. Now that we’re invited to the Zoom wedding and “celebration,” are we expected to give a gift? We barely know the groom and never met the bride.ine out of 10 wedding questions I receive are about gifts. I find this nearly as odd as the pent-up anger over so-called “gift grabs” (being invited to weddings where we think we’re only wanted for our gifts).I can’t tell whether this invitation is welcome or suspect to you. But it’s pretty simple either way: If you want to go to the Zoom wedding, say yes, then log in and send a token gift. If you don’t, decline politely and call it a day."
26,2020-09-03,"My husband, our tween son and I moved into a new house at the beginning of the year. We didn’t meet our neighbors before the pandemic hit; we still haven’t. After the horrible police shooting of Jacob Blake last week, our son made a beautiful Black Lives Matter poster and asked if he could display it on our lawn. We were proud to! A few days later, our neighbors seemed to respond with a Blue Lives Matter sign on their lawn. It hurts our hearts when we see it. Were we wrong to put up our son’s lawn sign? Can we talk to the neighbors about theirs?he pity of Blue Lives Matter, as I’ve seen the slogan deployed, is that it springs from a zealous denial that Black lives matter. Even the parroting name makes it seem like a childish, schoolyard taunt.But aren’t our hearts and minds big enough to acknowledge that many Black people suffer terrible injustice in this country because of their race, often at the hands of police, and, simultaneously, that law enforcement plays an important role in society? It’s not an either/or proposition.Your son did well by channeling his distress at police violence into a productive project. And you were right to support him. (You may even introduce the subject of police reform.) But your neighbors are entitled to their opinions, too, however much they hurt your heart. That’s how free speech works.Now, I get the awkwardness of dueling lawn signs among next-door strangers. So, go over and introduce yourselves (masked and distant). Be friendly. And leave the signs out of it. If a neighborly friendship develops, you may find a time to discuss this with them later..Christoph NiemannIs It Safe to Say Goodbye?My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer two years ago. Sadly, treatment failed, and she has now moved into a hospice facility. Her doctors expect she has a few months to live. My siblings visit every day, but I haven’t seen her in months. I live several hours away. My mom keeps calling and asking me to visit, but I’m really afraid of my family’s failure to take Covid prevention seriously. I want to be there for my mom, but I don’t want to get sick. Help! have strong feelings about how I would handle this in your place, but I am not you. (No one is!) Stop wasting your time consulting newspaper columnists and other nonmedical civilians. Call your mother’s doctor or the people who run the hospice. I’m pretty sure they can help you minimize the risks of visiting your dying mother — both to her and to you.Losing a parent can be devastating and scary, not least because it brings our own mortality into focus. Try putting your feelings aside for as long as it takes to consult the experts and make a rational decision. You may regret waiting until events make it for you.Hey, That’s My Daughter!I was walking my dog past an apartment building. There was a puddle of dog pee on the front step. My dog sniffed it and moved on. On our way home, the doorman from the building came out to put bleach on the step. As we passed, he tossed bleach from the jug at my dog, saying she peed on the step, though I told him she hadn’t. Luckily, he missed. But who would be so cruel? I tried calling the building to report him, but no one answered because of the pandemic. What should I do?n underappreciated fact: Doormen are front-line workers. When pet owners let their dogs pee on steps, doormen have to clean it up, often exposing themselves to people without masks who walk too close. This doesn’t excuse the doorman’s nasty behavior, but it may explain his stress and anger during a pandemic.Go back to the building and tell the doorman politely that you know we’re all under pressure now, but your dog did not pee on his step, and even if she had, tossing cleaning fluid at an animal is inhumane. (Better to ask the owner to clean it up.) If he still won’t acknowledge his error, call the building again or your local animal control agency.Back-to-School WoesMy younger sister and I will be going to the same school this year. We start in-person classes after Labor Day. The problem: She copies my style! I put a lot of thought into the way I dress, and it bugs me to see a copycat come down the stairs every morning. My mother won’t get involved. Will you?f all the ways I imagined a question about in-person learning during a pandemic would play out, none included copycat dressing. But I’m an older brother, so I get your frustration, Jilly.Let me suggest another way to look at this. Your younger sister admires you and may not have as much confidence in her fashion sense. Why not style her for a week? Help her come up with her own look, and she may back off yours."
27,2020-09-10,"My friend’s son is a deadbeat. He’s 35, still lives at home, has never kept a job for longer than a year, buys things he can’t afford, and now his pregnant girlfriend is moving in. He has a million excuses for everything that goes wrong. It’s never his fault! The problem: My friend and I play golf three times a week, and I can’t tolerate listening to him complain about his son anymore. How do I tell him to wise up and stop supporting him? I don’t want to hurt my friend, but he needs to hear the truth.hen I was a kid, I watched my mother burn through a cavalcade of friends because she failed to respect an unspoken rule of civil society: We can complain to friends about family members all we want, but friends must never say a bad word about those family members to us, even in the same conversation. (In-laws are occasionally excepted.)Like you, my mother thought she was doing what had to be done — a noble truth teller. But she was also dunking on other people’s loved ones. And it rarely worked! Do you really think you have something new to tell your friend about his son? You think “tough love” never crossed his mind? Keep quiet and concentrate on golf.Now, if you simply can’t contain yourself, the next time your friend starts in on his son, ask, “Are you venting, or would you like my opinion?” Even if he claims to want advice, remember: No one wants to hear his child being trashed by a golfing buddy. Just suggest they visit a therapist together or tell a deprecating story about your own child and how you solved the problem..Christoph NiemannFinal DiningMy husband and I received a gift certificate to a neighborhood restaurant shortly before the coronavirus pandemic. The restaurant closed for months, then reopened for takeout and outdoor dining. I’ve felt uncomfortable using the certificate, knowing how restaurants are struggling. Now the restaurant is closing for good, and my husband wants to use the certificate before it does. I say we chalk it up to a donation. You?ell, you’re certainly entitled to use the gift certificate. But I agree with you, Audrey: If you can afford to let this go, it seems miserly to force a restaurant that’s failed because of a pandemic to honor a gift certificate. Still, if you want one last meal at your neighborhood restaurant, I can get behind using the certificate so long as you really make it rain tip money all over the joint. The workers are suffering, too.Thanksgiving in 2020For seven years, we’ve hosted Thanksgiving dinner at our home in Oregon. We’ve always invited a couple from San Francisco who are conservative. (The husband, for instance, denies climate change.) To keep things civil, we send an email to the other guests reminding them to avoid politics, though the conservative husband is still outspoken. My husband doesn’t want to exclude them, but for me, this year is different. I would like to call the wife, with whom I’m close, and tell her that our tradition is on hold this year because of our momentous presidential election. With Covid, we will be down to six guests without them, but we can’t use Covid as an excuse. Any advice?y blood sugar may be low, but I reject nearly every premise of your question. Reputable models of Covid-19 prevalence (and a cursory glance at Labor Day stories on Instagram) suggest the pandemic will still be going strong at the end of November. Why can’t you “use Covid as an excuse”? It’s the only sensible thing to do.Also — spoiler! — the election will be over by Thanksgiving. Are you saying you won’t be able to dine with conservative friends three weeks later? And why do you only send emails to like-minded dinner guests to avoid politics, but not to the blowhard climate denier?By Thanksgiving, it will probably be too chilly in Oregon to entertain safely outdoors. I suggest suspending all invitations to an indoor Thanksgiving, except to those who are in your Covid bubble. Your political concerns are your call, but in my view, they run a distant second to the safety of you and your guests.The Copycat Sister Strikes BackI don’t know if you do follow-up questions, but I’m the girl who wrote last week about my younger sister copying my style when she dresses for school. You suggested that I style her for a week and help her find her own look. My mother thought this was a great idea, but I knew it wouldn’t work. And it didn’t. She still copies me. Any other ideas?hanks for rubbing my nose in my failure! Unfortunately, borrowing an aesthetic is not a crime punishable by law. So, if you can’t persuade your younger sister to be more original, perhaps the best solution here is to dig deep and tweak your own look (and keep tweaking it as she catches up with you). Necessity, as you now know, is the mother of invention."
28,2020-09-17,"For four years, my family has been great friends with the family next door. Their kids are the same age as ours, I became close with the mother, our husbands even work together. But during quarantine, my friend started sharing conspiracy theories about the trafficking of children. She believes “PizzaGate” is real and that Hollywood celebrities sacrifice children to drink their blood. I’ve tried to explain the alt-right origins of non falsehoods. Still, in every conversation, she says something like, “I won’t shop at Wayfair. They traffic children inside storage units.” I’ve asked her nicely to stop talking about conspiracy theories with me, but she won’t. How do we move on from this?or years, I’ve advised readers to talk it out. Whether it’s the mundane absence of a thank-you note or the highly charged presence of a Confederate flag, a calm and humble approach — one friend to another — is nearly always worth it. We may not persuade anyone in this dangerous age of so-called alternative facts, but we’re truly sunk when we stop trying.You say you’ve tried (and failed) to disabuse your friend about non and its lurid stories of blood lust and child trafficking. So, try listening. Ask her to walk you through the proof of her allegations. Perhaps you can help her see (gently) that she believes these dangerous lies because she wants to — not because she has any evidence for them.Now, I’ll be the first to admit that persuading your friend is unlikely; the ideas she has clung to reflect a distinct lack of interest in seeking out factual information. And you’re not in charge of her beliefs. If you don’t make progress with her (or with her husband, if that feels appropriate), back away from the friendship for now. Trying to salvage a relationship is worth it. Battering your head against a brick wall is not.Pity PaymentsBefore the pandemic, we had a housekeeper come to our apartment twice a month. We’ve continued to pay her because it felt cruel to cut her income while ours stayed the same. But now it seems as if I’ll be working remotely for good. To burn off nervous energy, I clean the apartment every day. It’s never been cleaner! And I would feel uncomfortable having the housekeeper here, while I work and my kids go to school remotely. At what point should I stop paying her?’ve been touched (and surprised, frankly) by the many readers who’ve reported paying their housekeepers, landscapers and babysitters through the pandemic, even though they were unable to work. (You’d be surprised, too, if you got as many letters as I do from people who fume about splitting checks when the other guy orders an extra glass of wine.)I applaud your generosity. Going forward, give your housekeeper plenty of notice if she believes she’s coming back to work for you. Call her and tell her you’re planning to clean your apartment yourself, but you don’t want to leave her in the lurch. Depending on her workload and your relationship, consider paying her for another month or two while she tries to replace your gig..Christoph NiemannP.S. I Wrote About YouI write short stories. Many of them are personal and based on real-life experiences. I’ve been publishing in literary journals for over a decade, confident that 99 percent of my acquaintances will never read a word. But now, a collection of my stories is being published as a book. The publisher has excerpted a revealing story about an ex on the book’s web page. This increases the chance that my ex and others will become aware of what I’ve written. Should I give the people involved a heads up?ongratulations on your book! If I understand correctly, you’ve been publishing fictionalized memoir for years and have no regrets about it. If you’re like many writers, in fact, your work is urgent and important to you. So, who cares if the book’s web page makes it (slightly) more likely to be seen by those who’ve inspired you?Writing is your art! You’re welcome to show advance copies to anyone you like. But if you haven’t for the last 10 years, why start now? Do you think Anna Wintour’s former assistant gave her a “heads up” before she published “The Devil Wears Prada”?Language LessonIs it  to tell white people they are not “native”? I follow the Twitter account of a white woman who calls herself “a native Oaklander.” But it is the Ohlone people who are native to Oakland, and this woman claims no ties to the Ohlone. Wouldn’t it be better to say, “born and raised in Oakland,” without the appropriation?eing careful about the words we use to describe racial and ethnic groups is important. The term “Native American” became popular in the 20th century; “Native” and “Indigenous” have also grown in usage and should be deployed according to a person’s or group’s preferences.Lowercase “native,” a centuries-old descriptor of people or plants that hail from a particular place, only refers to geography. So while I understand what you’re saying, I think there are bigger battles to fight."
29,2020-09-24,"When we visit my mother, she speaks to me in Hungarian, her native language, in front of my husband who doesn’t understand a word of it. He told me he feels excluded by this because he can’t participate in our conversations. I’ve told my mother her behavior is rude, but she persists, saying, “I am Hungarian, and this is my house.” She is fluent in English, so she could honor our request if she wanted to. Also, she and I speak on the phone frequently. If she had something private to say to me, she could do it then. Otherwise, she’s nice to my husband. Any advice?any people get defensive about criticism. (It’s pretty human actually, even if annoying.) And this is your mother. So, presumably, you’re willing to take a few extra steps to make things right. Rather than calling her behavior rude, which it assuredly is, talk to her privately about your husband’s feelings.Say, “He enjoys our visits with you but feels hurt when we exclude him by speaking Hungarian. Can we use English when he’s around?” Framing the issue this way may help her sympathize with your husband and (with a few gentle reminders) go along with your request.If she still refuses to speak English during your visits, your mother may be waging a small war for dominance over your husband. Shut that down! Tell her: “Making him feel unwelcome by cutting him out of our conversations only means he’ll be less willing to visit. And if he visits less frequently, so will I.”With luck (and a bit of self-interest), your mother may see the light. If she won’t be persuaded, though, give your husband dispensation from further visits and let him know you tried your best. Stubbornness is no excuse for letting anyone treat our partners disrespectfully..Christoph NiemannP.P.E. ProblemsI am a physician assistant working at an urgent care facility. I test patients for coronavirus frequently. I wear appropriate personal protective equipment all day, every day: double masks, gown, gloves and face shield. Still, I managed to contract the virus two months ago and pass it to my boyfriend. We caught it early, isolated for two weeks and did not give it to his roommates. But since then, the roommates have told him (in effect) he shouldn’t come home if he is still seeing me. What should we do?h, how we love our frontline workers — from a distance! Schedule a Zoom call with your boyfriend and his roommates. Walk them through the safety measures you take — “all day, every day,” as you put it — and see if that reassures them. Give them a chance to ask questions.Their fear isn’t irrational. But with transparency and open dialogue, they may realize that indirect contact with you is probably safer than living with someone who is careless about masks or who goes to house parties or indoor rallies. Even if you don’t persuade them, you will have done what you can to bring clarity to the conflict.My Home Isn’t Free StorageMy 24-year-old daughter lives with three roommates. She asked if she could store some furniture at my apartment because she didn’t have room for it. I am already overwhelmed with her belongings at my place, so I said no — which I shouldn’t have done. She told me she could get a storage locker for $40 a month. Now, it turns out the storage locker is $200 a month, and she signed a five-month contract. I wrote her a check for $1,000, but she refuses to accept it and remains furious at me. I feel terrible! What can I do to repair this situation?top babying your adult child! If you are overwhelmed with her belongings at your place, it was reasonable to refuse taking more of them, especially if you believed, as she told you, that she could solve the problem for $40 a month.Now that you know she misreported the cost of the storage locker, your offer to pay the entire expense seems downright generous to me. If your daughter prefers to nurse a childish grudge, though, there’s not much you can do to stop her. As a practical matter, being forced to pay cash from her own pocket may prompt a steely-eyed edit of the belongings she really wants to keep.No-Smoking ZoneI live in a townhome community where every unit has a small patio. My next-door neighbor steps onto my patio to smoke in front of my sliding glass door. I am working remotely, so as I sit at my table, I see her standing there with a cigarette. During the last few years, she has suffered from mental health issues, and I’ve tried to be supportive. How do I stop her from smoking on my patio?B.By asking her nicely to smoke on her own patio. I admire your sensitivity, but nearly one in five American adults lives with a mental illness. That’s no reason to treat your neighbor as if she were made of spun sugar or unable to observe reasonable neighborly boundaries."
30,2020-10-01,"I am a Democrat in a very red state. I work at a small service business where I interact with customers in person. Several of my co-workers wear bright red “Make America Great Again” caps. So, I bought a Joe Biden T-shirt to express my views. Recently, though, my boss, the owner of the company, issued a rule that “customer-facing employees” are not allowed to wear political garb. I can’t wear my shirt, but the accounting guys in the back office can still wear their  hats. I don’t think this is fair. Do you? What about my First Amendment rights? little anecdote: Last week, I interviewed two plumbers for a small job at my house. They both seemed competent, had good references and their estimates were comparable. But one of them had a bumper sticker that rubbed me the wrong way. So, I hired the other guy.I sympathize, in part, with the owner of your company. She or he probably wants to avoid alienating customers with political gear that’s irrelevant to the services you provide. But you’re right, too: Applying this rule only to certain employees is unfair. The company should prohibit political speech across the board or not at all.Before you go roaring into your boss’s office, though, make sure you’ve considered the power differential between you. Will you be risking your good standing at the company (or maybe your job itself) by complaining? Workers at small private companies typically have few legal protections.If you decide to speak up, be polite: “I respect your right to ban campaign gear at work. But the rule should apply to everyone. Otherwise, you’re giving special rights to some employees, but not to others. I hope you’ll consider my request.”And a parting note on the First Amendment, which is frequently misunderstood: Generally, it prevents the state from restricting freedom of speech, religion and peaceful assembly. It doesn’t apply to small private companies like yours..Christoph NiemannHouseguest-in-LawMy husband and I live in New York but decamped to the suburbs to stay with my mother-in-law for the summer and fall. It’s been a godsend. (We were cooped up and driving each other crazy in our apartment.) But it came to a dramatic halt when my mother-in-law’s neighbor invited us over. My husband and I assumed it would be a small outdoor gathering. But the neighbor had invited 70 people! When we saw the crowd, mostly without masks, we refused to go in and told my mother-in-law we thought it was unsafe. She went anyway. We returned to the city the next day and told her that we wouldn’t come back for two weeks, pending the assurance that she would behave safely while we’re gone. She agreed. But what if she doesn’t?or a couple of long-term moochers, you certainly are free with your demands. I’m glad you didn’t go to the party, of course; it sounded unsafe. If your mother-in-law is like mine, though, she may have felt guilty not going after saying she would. (It doesn’t make sense to me, either!) Or maybe she’s reckless.Going forward, stop making assumptions. Have a respectful discussion with your mother-in-law about the safety precautions to which she will commit, including at social events. If they’re acceptable to you and your husband, go back. If not, settle in for a cooped-up winter in the city.But I Didn’t Speed!I was running late for a dental appointment. I was going to bike there, which would have made me even later. But my roommate offered to give me a ride. (I didn’t ask.) On the way there, she got a speeding ticket. And that night, she presented it to me as if it were my responsibility to pay. I think that’s absurd! I didn’t speed. Thoughts?S.J.It’s true that the choice to speed was your roommate’s. And as a general matter, the person behind the wheel is responsible for driving mishaps.But surely you also see that, were it not for you and your dental appointment, your roommate would not have been driving the car that fateful day. This argues (to me) for picking up the ticket as a gesture of thanks or making your roommate a counteroffer to split the fine. Does that sound less absurd to you?Do Wedding Delays Mean Gift Delays?My nephew planned to be married in a big ceremony in October. For safety reasons, the couple decided to wed privately on the scheduled date and postpone the big celebration until October 2021. So, when do we give our gift: now or at the party next year?hese are tough times for people missing their big day. Still, I commend the bridal couple for putting the safety of their guests first. I would send a token gift now with a warm note letting them know you’re thinking of them, and bring your real gift to the party. Or reverse the gift order, if you like, but send the note now. I bet they’re really disappointed."
31,2020-10-08,"I am a single mom with a young son. Because of the pandemic, I had to postpone a necessary (but nonemergency) surgery. My doctor thinks I should have it now. I plan to leave my son at my sister’s house for a few days. The problem: Her husband is an avid hunter, and I’m scared of leaving my child in a house with guns. I have no reason to think my brother-in-law is careless with them, but the fact that I’ve seen his rifle indoors worries me. How should I approach this issue? I’m already asking for a favor. How difficult am I allowed to be?’m sorry, but you are thinking about this all wrong. Your job is to keep your son safe, not to placate your brother-in-law. Guns are inherently dangerous, as evidenced by thousands of accidental shootings every year. And keeping your stress level low after surgery is probably important for your recovery. So, let’s talk this out.If a secure gun lock or safe would give you any comfort, ask your sister or brother-in-law how and where they store his guns. And don’t be shy about it: “Can I see the setup, please?” Be honest with yourself, though. If the mere presence of guns in the house makes you uneasy, skip this step. Storage information won’t help you.Level with your sister, instead: “I’m really afraid of the guns. Is there any way you can stay with my son at my house?” If she agrees, thank her profusely. If she doesn’t, move on to different candidates. Maybe your parents can help you out, or a friend?I get that asking for favors can be tough. But you will create more trouble for yourself in the long run by pretending to be  when you’re not. A moment of awkwardness now is nothing compared to the worry you may feel later by having agreed to an arrangement that — rightly or not — makes you uncomfortable..Christoph NiemannThe Couple That Doomscrolls Together …My boyfriend and I moved in together a few months ago, a first for both of us, and we’re still getting used to spending time together that we’d normally have spent alone, free to scroll, watch  or zone out. But my partner is addicted to an endless loop of Twitter and Instagram. I’m not sure how to tell him it’s hurtful when he stares at his screen the whole time we’re in bed, watching  or at a restaurant. I’ve tried to bring it up, but he counters, “You’re on your phone all the time, too,” which feels defensive and dismissive. Any advice?very story I know from the annals of cohabitation includes a few bugs to be worked out at the beginning (especially now, during a pandemic, when many couples are spending much more time together and have fewer safe outlets away from home).You don’t say whether your boyfriend’s assertion that you’re also on your phone all the time is true. But I’d embrace it as truth. It may help him feel less defensive. Respond: “You’re right. Let’s work out some times when we both put our phones away and focus on each other.”Eliminate screens at meals and when one of you asks for undivided attention. Maybe agree to scroll during  shows, but not in bed? I’m not the arbiter here, though. You have to negotiate this with your boyfriend. If he refuses to compromise at all, that’s a bigger problem, and graduates you from advice columns to couples’ therapy.T.M.I., !My dear friend of many years, whom I speak to every day, insists on giving me a rundown of her bathroom habits. I have told her more than once that I don’t want to discuss the subject, and I try to steer her in other directions, to no avail. What do you suggest?ost readers will simply assume your friend is gross. But if she’s really a “dear friend” and you speak every day, she must have some lovely qualities, too. So, you’ve asked her not to broach a subject and she’s ignored you. Fine.For the next week, in deference to your long friendship, interrupt her the second she raises the topic: “I don’t want to discuss this.” If she continues to disregard your request, after a solid week of shutting her down, the call is yours: Do her good qualities outweigh further reporting on her digestive tract, or would you rather call these conversations quits?What, No One Eats Anymore?I entertain often. Increasingly, guests who show up refuse all food. I serve healthy and tasty fare. And I don’t care whether people eat or not — I just don’t want gobs of leftovers. Is it now a thing to be too cool for food?o my knowledge, people are still eating. But as coronavirus cases rise in most states, it seems sensible for guests to skip communal dining in favor of consistent mask wearing. As for avoiding leftovers, why not let your recent experiences guide the amount of food you prepare?"
32,2020-10-15,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s. We don’t have any conditions that put us at a high risk for serious illness if we get Covid-19. We’ve been taking it pretty seriously, though. We don’t live together, but we only hang out with our roommates and a few friends we trust. Last week, my boyfriend announced that he’d signed up to be a poll worker on Election Day. I said, “Over my dead body!” Since then, we fight about it all the time without getting anywhere. He thinks it’s important to help. I say it’s too risky to me and others in our Covid pod. At my mom’s suggestion, we’ve agreed to let you settle this for us. What do you think?’m flattered, but who cares what I think? Never delegate important issues in your relationship to other people, much less strangers. Would you ask a rando to decide whether you should move in together or have kids? I’m happy to share my opinion, but only if it helps you negotiate a compromise you can both tolerate.I get your fear (and maybe surprise) at your boyfriend’s announcement. He should have discussed it with you first. But your response (“Over my dead body!”) shut the door on conversation precisely when you needed it most. Next time, say, “Hang on! Let’s talk about this. It affects me too.”Personally, I admire your boyfriend’s decision. Many poll workers are older and at greater risk during the pandemic. So, his offer to step in and help with the election, the most important vehicle in our democracy, seems noble to me. I hope you recognize your boyfriend’s patriotism.And risk mitigation seems pretty simple here. Your boyfriend will be masked at the polling place, as will the vast majority of sensible voters. So, the risk of viral transmission seems low. If you’re still worried, ask him to steer clear of you for two weeks. Sure, that’s an inconvenience, but one in service to an excellent cause..Christoph NiemannThe Eyesore Next DoorWe live in a subdivision of 29 homes, most with attractive grounds. Our homeowners’ association agreement forbids any active businesses. But our neighbor has an active landscaping business. He parks two large pickup trucks in his driveway containing ladders and riding mowers; they’re often stuffed with brush. When the trucks aren’t there, his driveway is lined with unsightly black bags of landscaping materials. The problem: The board of our association consists of a single member, a realtor who was an early resident. She’s undergoing treatment for breast cancer, and we hate to trouble her. We don’t have a relationship with our neighbor. Any suggestions?arking two trucks in a driveway hardly constitutes running an active business. Maybe storing bags of landscaping materials on the property comes closer to a violation. That said, you and I won’t fix this problem in a vacuum. You will have to speak up.Call the realtor who runs the board and ask if she can field a question about the homeowners’ agreement. If she is too ill to help, ask who can. Or speak to your neighbor directly about alternative storage for the ugly bags. (Maybe behind his house?) Or seethe quietly for the rest of your born days. Those, I believe, are your options.So Much for a Friendly LoanMy friend borrowed two new folding tables for a drive-by baby shower. When I dropped them off, I asked her husband for a marker to write my name on the undersides. He said he’d do it. When I went back to pick them up, the two tables left weren’t mine. They were old and beaten up. Her husband asked me to take the tables anyway and sort it out with the other guests. But I don’t know the other guests! So, I asked him to work it out. A few weeks and reminders later, no word from them. Should I let this go?M.The sting of stories like yours is rarely about the tables. More often, it’s that our friends apparently fail to appreciate our kindness. If the baby has already come, let this go. (New babies are tough customers!)Otherwise, call your friend and tell her you know she’s busy, but you’re disappointed that she and her husband blew you off about the tables. Then, having cleared the air and given her one last reminder to fix the problem, think of the tables as another shower gift. And tell her you look forward to meeting the new baby.Your Perfect Son? Yeah RightMy brother and his wife constantly brag about their two children. (I mean, constantly!) Would it be evil of me to let them know that I know their teenage son was arrested recently for driving under the influence? I could slip it casually into conversation.t’s cruel to rejoice in the misfortune of a child because you bear a silly grudge against his parents. Especially here, where the boy could have hurt himself or someone else. As for his parents’ bragging, hasn’t anyone told you that braggarts only seem self-confident? Usually, they’re overcompensating for insecurity. Play nice!"
33,2020-10-22,"I am a recent college graduate. I came out to my mom as transgender once I got a job, moved in with great roommates and felt safer in the world. She was shocked and not nice about it when I first told her. But to her credit, she did her research and came around pretty quickly. She’s even been supportive of me recently. The problem: She intends to vote for political candidates who want to deny me and other trans people basic rights and take back the few legal protections we do have. I’ve tried to explain to her that her votes will harm me, but she doesn’t care. And that hurts. Any advice?J.L.I get that your mother’s politics feel like a personal rejection, but try to be patient with her. She sounds like a quick study: fast to recognize that her love for you is greater than her abstract discomfort at having a transgender child. It may take an election cycle (or two) for her to connect that love with political support for other trans people.That’s how it was with my parents when I came out. And in time, they were great allies. Many parents need a minute to process our identities, just like we do. No promises, though. Because I also have friends whose (inevitably estranged) parents have never been able to connect the dots between the children they love and the rights they deserve.Remember too: Your mother is not only a mother. She is entitled to her own vote. But for the sake of your relationship, I hope she soon comes to value the equal protection of all people. If there’s a support group nearby, like , for parents and friends of L.G.B.T.Q. people, steer her there. She may find comfort and wisdom in that community. (And for the record, I think you’re doing a great job!).Christoph NiemannDivvying Up the InheritanceIn the ’70s, I bought a beautiful photograph by William Eggleston for not much money. My parents admired it, so I gave it to them. Now that my father has died, 10 years after my mother, I assumed the photo would come back to me. It’s appreciated tremendously in value. After their house, it’s probably the most valuable asset in my parents’ estate. But my siblings feel differently. They think they have a right to share in the value of the Eggleston I bought. This strikes me as selfish. You?H.The good news? You have exquisite taste in art. And you were generous to your parents. But if you really gave the picture to them, 40-plus years ago, it’s now part of their estate. Unless they bequeathed it to you in their wills, its value will be divided among their beneficiaries like the rest of their personal property.When we give something away, it’s not ours anymore. If you can afford it, your siblings probably won’t object to your taking the photograph and a smaller portion of your parents’ other assets. An estate lawyer can help you divide things fairly, crediting the value of the photograph against your share of the estate.To Gather, or Not to Gather?My grandparents, who are in their 80s, are coming up on a big wedding anniversary. They invited me (four days out) to a celebratory brunch at an indoor restaurant, noting the tables will be “appropriately spaced.” My grandparents have been careful during the pandemic, but they think this is a risk worth taking for the occasion. Other relatives who have not been so vigilant about precautions are also going. I’ve been careful, but I haven’t isolated for two weeks. If I’d known about the party, I would like to have done that to protect my grandparents. What do I do?here used to be little downside in going to badly conceived parties. Not anymore! Tell your grandparents, in a loving way, that their risk assessment is seriously flawed. Neither you, nor your less careful relatives, should gather with octogenarians for indoor dining while coronavirus cases surge in most states. It’s too dangerous!Now, this decision may not sit well with your family members. (Physical separation has been one of the true heartaches of this pandemic.) But I’d rather be unpopular and have everyone survive until Christmas. Still, you can’t control anyone’s behavior but yours. Skip the party, with sincere apologies, and offer to celebrate with your grandparents privately, at home, 14 days after all of you have resumed strict safety protocols.How Sweet …Since March, my family has been patronizing several local restaurants with weekly takeout orders to help them survive the pandemic. One of them regularly includes free desserts that we didn’t order and don’t want. How do we decline these generous gifts without hurting anyone’s feelings?se your words, Poppy! Why would a restaurateur resent a regular patron for declining free food? Say, “We really appreciate the free desserts you’ve been sending, but can you leave them out from now on?” You may need to repeat this request when you order. The free desserts may be a general marketing strategy of the grateful restaurant, and not aimed at you specifically."
34,2020-10-29,"A new friend in the Midwest was invited to an outdoor Halloween party where mask-wearing was requested. We went shopping for an art-inspired costume for her. But I saw that she was gravitating toward period costumes. After the party, she posted pictures online. I was stunned! She wore a full-blown Scarlett O’Hara-type gown — to a mansion, no less! If I’d known, I would have tried to talk her out if it. This year’s widespread Black Lives Matter protests, along with the traditional whitewashing of the antebellum South, make her choice seem insensitive. I’ll be seeing her soon, and I already feel awkward. I know she’ll share details of the party, and I feel obligated to enlighten her. Any advice?t’s one thing if your friend went to the party dressed as Scarlett O’Hara. Casually masquerading as the heroine of a racist novel and film in which Black people are portrayed as happy slaves is problematic. Costume parties don’t offer enough context for racial commentary.But it’s another thing if your friend simply rented a Victorian dress with a crinoline underneath to make the skirt poof out. That style originated in England and became fashionable in many places (with ever larger hoop skirts) in the mid-19th century. The dresses are not primarily associated slavery or the South. Women in the North wore them, too.So, which was she: dressed as a character, or from an era? Be careful about jumping to racism. (Your desire to “enlighten” your friend sounds condescending.) If you’re not sure, ask her: “What was your Halloween costume?” If she says Scarlett, ask if she considered the racial implications. If not, save your energy for clear-cut instances of racism..Christoph NiemannDying WishI broke up with my boyfriend during our coronavirus quarantine. Recently, he was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He begged me not to let him die alone. So I now have frequent video chats with him, accompany him to doctors’ appointments and even stayed overnight in the hospital with him after he was admitted for pneumonia. The problem: He thinks we’re back together again and wants to resume our sex life (which his doctor blessed). I don’t have those feelings for him anymore, but I don’t want to hurt him, either. Should I have mercy sex with him or tell him I’m not into him?either! By your kind behavior, you’ve shown that you’re a good and loyal friend to your ex. Tell him you want to continue supporting him during this challenging period, but you haven’t changed your mind about the breakup.Now, this may hurt his feelings or even make him angry with you. Give him time to work through his emotions, but don’t sleep with him out of pity. If I were in your ex’s position, I would value a great friend more than a lover who was only acting the part. Wouldn’t you?Puppy ProblemsDuring the pandemic, our three kids convinced us to adopt a puppy from our local animal shelter. Spoiler alert: Raising a puppy is much harder than we thought. And ours is destructive. We’re considering returning him to the shelter, but we feel guilty about it and our kids don’t want us to. What should we do?H.G.I think you feel guilty about returning the puppy to the shelter because you should. When you adopted him, you made a commitment to the dog, the shelter and your family to provide a good home for him. Going back on your promise too easily would be bad for everyone.Call the shelter and tell the adoption coordinator that you’re having real trouble with the puppy and need help. The shelter may offer assistance or connect you with a trainer. I know that raising a puppy is hard work. But until you’ve tried your best, it would be wrong to return him. (And depending on the shelter, doing so may have deadly consequences for the puppy.)Follow-Up  am the sister of the man who wrote to you last week, wanting to take back a now valuable photograph from our parents’ estate because he gave it to them many years ago. He was right when he said his siblings objected, but neither he nor you explored why that is. My sister devoted untold hours to taking care of our parents. And I gave them substantial financial help to allow them to stay in their home. Our brother was mostly missing in action. Additional thoughts now?’m glad you wrote. Family situations are almost always more complex than a single anecdote can convey. That’s why I try not to judge anyone and suggested that your brother leave the photograph in your parents’ estate.But now that I have you, let me encourage you to sit down with your siblings (when it’s safe to do that) and get beyond this conflict. You’ve all suffered a big loss with the death of your parents, and your support for each other may be much more valuable than any Eggleston photograph. (And I love Eggleston!) It’s just stuff."
35,2020-11-05,"My new boss started working at the company in August amid the pandemic. He has an office with a door that shuts; I work at an open cubicle in a high-traffic area. Our employer has told us repeatedly to work remotely whenever possible. But my boss has been in the office every day since he started. Recently, he told me I should increase the number of days I work in person. But many of my co-workers do all their work remotely, as does my boss’s boss. I understand my boss is trying to make his way in a new job, but how do I get him to respect our company’s remote work policy? I want a good relationship with him, but not at the cost of getting Covid-19.ather the facts before you go up against your new boss (nicely). You say your “employer” told you to work remotely “whenever possible.” But who exactly do you mean: the C.E.O., a human resources employee or someone else? Contact that person’s office, without a whisper of complaint, and verify that the policy is still in place and includes your position.Then talk to your boss at a time that’s convenient for him. Say, “I want to be helpful to you and the company, but I don’t feel safe sitting out in the open. I believe I’m working effectively from home, and I’d prefer to follow the company’s policy on remote work. Do you feel differently?”With luck (and a semi-reasonable boss), you may be able to talk through this issue. But if he believes your presence is sometimes necessary, which is also contemplated by the phrase “whenever possible,” you may have to appeal to a superior if you disagree, or change the subject to improving safety conditions at the office..Christoph NiemannBut My Pets Aren’t Predators!My next door neighbor asked me to consider putting collars with bells on my two cats. One of them had been playing with a chipmunk he befriended in her yard. I told her the cats were being cats, but I’d think about it. The next day, two collars with bells on them were on my doorstep when I got home from work. I’ve decided not to put them on my cats. Am I obligated to return the collars to her, or may I sell them on eBay?ot so fast, cat dad! You’re probably right about “cats being cats” — which also means that they are fierce predators when they’re outdoors. House cats have caused the extinction of dozens of species of birds, small mammals and reptiles. So, what might look like friendship between your cats and a chipmunk is more likely a killing ritual that can upset local ecosystems.Short of keeping your cats indoors, there is no easy way to stop this carnage. But several studies have shown that collars with bells can reduce the killings by about half. That’s why I think you should try the bells. You will learn quickly if your cats can tolerate the collars or if the jingle-jangling stresses them out.As for your neighbor, let’s call her well-meaning but a tad aggressive. (Still, how many chipmunk massacres would you care to witness on your lawn before springing to action?) If you are determined not to use the collars, return them to your neighbor with thanks. But I really hope you’ll give them a try.Is This … Flirting?My fiancé is an avid cyclist who posts his rides on social media. His ex-wife frequently comments on them on the same platform. I’ve told him this makes me uncomfortable, but he says it’s harmless. Her comments continue even when we’re on vacation. I think her behavior is creepy, and they should limit their interactions to matters relating to their adult children. Your view?B.I think it speaks well of your fiancé that he is cordial with his ex-wife. Casual posts about bike rides (including those taken while you’re on vacation) do not strike me as inappropriate or worrisome. Isn’t this what social media is for?I’m more concerned that you feel threatened by her posts. And I encourage you to explore with your fiancé why this is. We all have pasts. And moving forward with someone new doesn’t require pretending that we don’t (unless the past is flirting with our fiancé).Adult Son ProblemsMy son is in his 20s. He supports himself and lives on his own. During the pandemic, he has partied and behaved irresponsibly, in my view. When I push, he says he hopes he contracts the virus so he develops antibodies and can get on with his life. Help!our son sounds foolish and ill-informed, and I sympathize with him entirely. (Don’t we all want this to be over?) Still, many young people have developed serious illnesses after contracting Covid-19. And research on antibodies and the long-term damage that can follow the virus is still coming to light.By now, he should also be aware of the danger his risk-taking may pose to others more vulnerable to illness than he. But you and I won’t convince your son of anything. Have him call his doctor for sound medical advice. (And steer clear of him until he cleans up his act!)"
36,2020-11-12,"I board my horse at a commercial stable. For years, another boarder has reported me to management for breaking rules, like having my dog off-leash, which many other boarders do. I suspect she’s racist. I am one of only two nonwhite boarders, and she hasn’t reported anyone else. (Also, my dog is a breed that many people incorrectly assume is aggressive.) The barn manager responds to her complaints by accusing me of misbehavior instead of asking what happened. I’ve always shrugged off these episodes. But recently I had enough and told this boarder I would no longer tolerate her harassment. Then she complained that I threatened her, which the manager believes! How should I deal with this bullying? et’s handle the easy stuff first. Put your dog on a leash! When we enter into arrangements with businesses like stables or gyms, we agree to abide by certain rules to use the facilities. You aren’t. Dogs and horses are unpredictable creatures, and there’s plenty of data on dogs attacking horses to support the stable’s leash rule.When you’re in compliance with the rules, you will also be in a better position to assess possible racism there, as opposed to fear of your pit bull or Rottweiler. If the leash rule isn’t enforced against other boarders, ask the manager (with your leashed dog at your side): “Why aren’t you requiring everyone to use leashes?”I sympathize with your suspicion that you are being singled out because of race. But so far, the barn manager isn’t wrong. You admit to breaking the rules. In the law, there’s a principle called the clean-hands doctrine: People who aren’t in good faith or in compliance with rules (and have symbolically unclean hands) are not entitled to ask for relief. Same here: Follow the rules, then speak up about uneven enforcement..Christoph NiemannShaken From the Family TreeI am the family historian and am updating our family history. This includes the death of my niece’s husband, an accomplished university professor in his 30s and the father of two young boys. We were all devastated by this loss, especially my niece’s parents. So I was shocked when my widowed niece asked me emphatically not to include anything about her late husband in the family history. She pressured another niece to ask me to exclude him, too. I am a writer, so this smells of censorship to me. I am also concerned that my grandnephews will someday see my history and wonder why I didn’t include their father. What should I do? can only assume that your widowed niece has strong personal reasons for asking you to exclude her late husband from your history. And I would guess that you grasp this too, or you would have simply asked her why she wants you to omit him. Let’s not speculate about what those reasons may be.Now, on to your writing problem: I respect the task you’ve set for yourself. But your project will largely be of interest to living relatives. So, rather than brand your niece’s request as censorship, why not embrace the family spirit of your history more fully and prioritize your niece’s strong feelings? It’s the kind thing to do here.Constant ReferenceA friend and former colleague has been job hunting for over a year. When she asked me to be a reference, I said yes without hesitation. But now I have served as her reference over and over again, including for jobs she decided not to pursue. (She’s financially secure and unsure what she wants to do.) My frustration is my friend’s lack of acknowledgment. Sometimes she lists me without even telling me. I’ll continue to be her reference, but is there a nice way to tell her I’m feeling used and would like a gesture of kindness?etween us: You’re allowed to feel underappreciated without gilding the lily. In this year of crushing job losses, I find it hard to believe that your friend has been a finalist for a multitude of positions or that these reference calls take longer than 10 or 15 minutes.Still, your friend should, of course, notify you and thank you every time she lists you as a reference. But gratitude that comes by request is rarely satisfying. Tell her: “I’ve fielded several reference calls already. Please list me only if you are seriously interested in the job and make sure to tell me, ?”A Canvassing ConnectionI worked with a team to get out the vote in our recent elections. On a series of group calls on Zoom, I “met” a guy who seemed interesting: smart, handsome and funny. I don’t know whether he’s single, though. Would it be  for me to ask him out on a date?hy not? But take it a bit slower. Rather than calling it a date, say: “I’ve enjoyed getting to know you on our calls. Any chance you’d be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime?” If he says yes, meet up and get to know each other better (particularly whether he’s single)."
37,2020-11-20,"I was just informed that my sister’s boyfriend will be joining us for Thanksgiving. They’ve been going out for two years. I don’t like him and my other sibling downright hates him. Any other year, we could deal with this fairly easily; we have a big extended family. But this year, only immediate family members are coming to dinner because of Covid-19. I’d love to get past this in the spirit of family togetherness, but a big cause of the problem is my sister’s condescending attitude toward our other sibling and me when she’s with her boyfriend. Any suggestions other than strong holiday drinks?his may not be the advice you had in mind, but unless your immediate family is already part of a careful Covid pod, this is not the year for mixing households at Thanksgiving. If you can’t eat outdoors with social distance, the alarming increase in Covid infections and related hospitalizations and deaths makes your plan risky for family members and everyone they meet. Don’t you want to live to hate the boyfriend in the New Year?Now, as for him and your sister, going to her with a vague complaint of condescension is unlikely to accomplish much. Calmly share a few specific examples, prefaced by a sincere desire to get along better with her and her boyfriend. That’s the way to work through this problem..Christoph NiemannCan We Not With the Body Talk?My daughter is legally blind and functionally sighted. She has a service dog. At 29, she is extremely independent, and she’ll soon start grad school after working at a veterans’ hospital. She is popular and rarely idle. I love her dearly. The problem: She has slowly gained a lot of weight (maybe 50 pounds). She eats right, just too much. She starts diets, then lets them go. She exercises intermittently and has tried online dating without much success. Recently, I heard her say, “I have to lose some of this weight.” I don’t think everyone has to be thin, and I certainly don’t want to hurt her feelings. But I think she may be happier if she lost some weight. Any advice?our daughter is a competent adult. She is independent, hard-working and has family and friends who love her. By your own admission, she already knows that she’s heavy. (And I don’t see what her visual acuity has to do with any of this.) If she decides she wants to lose weight, for whatever reason (her health, if that’s an issue, or simply to conform to our culture’s unyielding preference for thinness), I have every confidence she will do it. If she asks for your support, give it.But for you say or signal to your daughter that her losing weight would make you happy — even if you phrased it as something you think would make her happy — you run the risk of shaming her and undercutting her self-esteem. You seem to have raised a wonderful daughter. Now, stand back and let her be her own woman.My Best Friend’s Boyfriend My best friend is in a relationship; she and I are both in our 20s. Recently, after a Tinder hookup, the guy hung around, and we showed each other people on the app we’d hooked up with before. I was shocked when he showed me my best friend’s picture. (I didn’t know she had a profile!) Should I tell her boyfriend?hat? Why tell the boyfriend? (And why are you hooking up during a pandemic?) Your question suggests that you feel considerable resentment for your best friend. Why else would you want to disrupt her relationship like this?For the record, her sex life is none of your business. And the hookup, if it happened, may have predated her relationship or be allowed by its terms. If you’re going to discuss this coincidence with anyone, make it your best friend (or a therapist).Neighborly Noise ComplaintWe live in a solid prewar building, and our neighbors are civil when we meet in passing, which is rare. The couple down the hall and their teenager let their heavy front door slam behind them when they come and go. This makes a loud bang that we hear in our apartment. It’s annoying and startling. I’ve been sitting on this for two years. I’ve rehearsed many ways to speak to them, but I’m afraid of creating bad blood. Should I just call the managing agent?ost of us dislike confrontation. But reporting your neighbors to the managing agent is much more aggressive than simply saying with a smile: “May I ask a favor? Could you close your front door behind you rather than let it slam? That banging really startles me.” They’ve probably never considered the issue.Try not to leave a note. Even the nicest writing doesn’t come with a neighborly smile. Just knock on their door if you can’t wait to bump into them in the hall. I predict wild success."
38,2020-11-26,"I am a recent college graduate. I am also drowning in student debt. On my salary, there is no way I can save money or think about buying an apartment while I make large payments on these loans. This will continue for 15 years at least. The pandemic “pause” on payments has been a huge relief. And I’m excited by the possibility of our new president doing something to forgive some of my student debt. But when I talked to my uncle about this, he got angry and took it very personally: “No one forgave my student loans!” I didn’t know how to respond or if I should have. But it’s awkward now. Any advice?our uncle’s apparent grievance at the prospect of social progress seems odd. When the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, for instance, I don’t recall older members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community expressing bitterness that they hadn’t enjoyed the right to marry in their youth. No, we all celebrated the decision as a big step on the road to greater equality.Same with student debt. The ever-rising cost of higher education has long worked as barrier to students of lesser means and saddled others with crippling debt loads. Black and Latino students have been disproportionately affected. And I would expect people who had experienced this hardship personally to applaud student debt reform.But your uncle is not the first person I’ve heard grumbling about it. Their take seems to be: “I suffered, why shouldn’t you?” But that’s not a cogent argument against fairer access to education. It’s just punitive. Tell him: “I’m sorry you had a hard time.” That may smooth things over between you. Then add (or just think): “But I’m glad others may not have to suffer.” We don’t have to say everything we believe to everyone..Christoph NiemannEnforcing the Playground Mask PolicyI live in a Covid bubble with my in-laws who are helping me care for my two toddlers. We are avid mask wearers. We live in a city where masks are required (for people over the age of 2) in all public places, including outdoors. At the playground, my father-in-law always reminds mask-less people they are breaking the rules. Recently, a family entered the playground, none of whom were wearing masks. My father-in-law told them they needed masks and asked them to stay away from my daughter. I know he was right, but I felt uncomfortable. Shouldn’t we have left if their behavior bothered us?E.L.Why should you leave? The rules are the rules: masks in public places, including playgrounds. Now, let me backtrack immediately. If your playground isn’t marked with a sign about masks at the entrance, encourage your father-in-law to be gentle in his requests to the maskless. They may not know. (I’ve taken to offering spare surgical masks to those who need them. So far, people don’t seem to hate this.)Still, I’ve read news reports of scuffles breaking out over mask debates, including a case that resulted in death. We don’t want that on the playground. So, if you hear or sense anything ominous in your father-in-law’s interactions, pack up your children and leave quickly. Better safe than sorry, no?Cool It With the Scripture Screenshots?Several years ago, I met a woman at church and we clicked. (We were both pregnant.) We were friendly, but not close. After our babies were born, I moved across the country and focused on new motherhood, a new city and a new job. My friend continued to text me, mostly to check in. But now, she sends (almost exclusively) screenshots of Christian devotionals and scriptures. I am not interested in them. She sends 15 screenshots for every personal message. I don’t want to be rude, but it’s overwhelming. Advice?C.I may be wrong, but I suspect your friend is sending these screenshot texts to a large group of recipients in a single stroke. There is nothing rude about opting out. Just say, “I like being in touch with you. But I’d rather not receive the devotional texts. Can you remove me from that list, please?” If there’s a relationship worth saving here, this won’t end it.Smoking PoliceMy next-door neighbor is one of my best friends. When the gas line to our house had to be enlarged, we discovered it ran under her driveway. She was lovely about giving us permission to dig up her land. This morning, I saw one of the gas company workers smoking a cigarette. I told him my friend prefers that no one smoke on her property. I don’t know if this is true. I dislike people smoking on my property, and I assume she feels the same. The worker gave me a cold stare, and my husband said I was officious and had no business saying anything. Your thoughts?ell, you lied. It’s not the worst one I’ve ever heard, but I’m not going to applaud you for it. Next time, limit your requests to activities taking place on your property. For what it’s worth, though, I expect the gas company would frown upon its employees smoking on the job."
39,2020-12-03,"My aunt died from Covid complications two weeks ago. This is my first time grieving a family member, and she’s really present in my mind. I’m not sure whether or how to bring this up with acquaintances and co-workers. I respond honestly if someone asks me a direct question about my family. But even casual questions — like “What did you do this weekend?” — make me think of my aunt. (I went to a Zoom funeral.) I don’t want to make things awkward for others, and I definitely don’t want to cry in front of my neighbors. But it feels wrong not to say the thing at the top of my mind. What’s the best way to handle this?ry in front of your neighbors! I’m sorry for your loss. Sadly, there is no “right” way to cope with grief. For now, give yourself permission to express your feelings, however they bubble up, and put aside your normally thoughtful attention to the comfort of others. This is a time for mourning, not for worrying about the guy in marketing.Now, it won’t take long to learn that some people and places are better for sharing feelings than others. “How are you?” asked in passing at the beginning of a Zoom meeting is qualitatively different than during a leisurely walk. Personal closeness counts too. But don’t discount strangers entirely. One of the best talks I had after my father died was with a man I’d never met on a Fifth Avenue bus.You will make your own path. Over time, you may feel less urgency in speaking of your aunt. But until then, be generous with yourself. An important person has left this world. Her loss and meaning in your life are important questions to consider..Christoph NiemannWafting Through the WindowMy mother lives in a senior-living apartment building. Residents can buy a meal plan or cook for themselves. The woman who lives beneath my mother cooks, and her cooking odors come directly into my mother’s apartment. My mother opens windows and turns on a special fan provided by management, but the smells persist. It doesn’t help that the woman cooks at 8 p.m., later than normal dinnertime. We realize this woman has every right to eat when she wants to, but shouldn’t management speak to her about ventilation in her apartment? Or maybe my mother should speak to the woman directly?isten, I get feeling protective of an older parent. But I’m also wary of unduly burdening the woman downstairs. She has a right to sustenance (even at the scandalous hour of 8 p.m.). And the responsibility for properly ventilating apartments falls squarely on the shoulders of building management. Don’t let up on them!The building should hire a mechanical engineer to solve this issue or move your mother to another unit. The woman downstairs may be asked for reasonable access to her apartment to fix the problem. But she has a right to cook and enjoy her unit, and it’s not fair to expect her to correct the building’s mechanical problems.About Your Alter Ego …I have a friend with whom I interact socially and professionally. In direct communication, he’s lovely. But his social media presence is toxic. He is quite far to the left, which is fine, but I’m tired of how vicious he is to anyone who disagrees with him. Our field operates on social media, so I can’t abandon the platform. Should I mute him or talk to him about his cursing and name-calling?he easy thing, of course, is to mute him and move along. But if he’s truly a friend, I think you have a duty to speak up. A few tips: Call him, no typed messages. And start with a positive statement: “I really value our friendship.”Then make your constructive criticism: “It upsets me to see you attack people on social media. It’s your right to express yourself, but I don’t think it reflects what a kind person you are. Maybe think about it?” Then listen. He may be defensive at first, then soften after time for reflection.Now You Tell Me?My brother married in May. But he only told me months later when I visited him for his birthday. His excuse was that Covid would have made it impossible for me to attend. He still could have told me! He called me yesterday for the first time since I learned the news. I was upset, so my responses were curt; he hung up on me. I’m at a loss for what to do next?hy not take your brother at his word? He decided it would be frustrating for you to know about the wedding and be unable to attend. And he waited to tell you until he could do it in person. (I buy it.) I also get that you don’t like it. But wouldn’t it be better to discuss how you’d prefer to handle news in the future than feud about possibly good-faith mistakes in the past?"
40,2020-12-10,"How can I ask my brother and sister-in-law not to give me a gift for Christmas? She does the shopping for their family, and while I know it’s the thought that counts, her presents are never to my taste or things I can use. (Some also appear to be regifts.) So, I donate them to charity shops or throw them away. This seems like a waste of their money, and I’m tired of recycling their gifts. I always spend a great deal of time choosing gifts that I think each member of their large extended family will like. But I feel less joy in it every year. Any thoughts? have one big thought actually — and it applies to everyone, not merely to virtuous shoppers like yourself, who spend countless hours hunting for that perfect gift only to receive rubbish in return. (Even better, it lets me sidestep the sanctimony embedded in your question.)Given the terrible suffering of this year — as millions of our neighbors struggle with joblessness, food insecurity and keeping a roof over their heads, and as many emergency programs enacted to help them through this once-in-a-lifetime crisis are expiring — it may be the perfect time to rethink holiday gifts more broadly.If you can picture a charitable gift being as satisfying (to giver and receiver) as four-ply cashmere, then ask your family and friends how they’d feel about a donation in their name to a charity that helps those in need this year. You can even discuss which charities you have in mind and encourage them to do the same. Now, this won’t work for everyone, but I hope you’ll consider it. So many of us don’t need or want for anything. And our communities are in dire straits now..Christoph NiemannThe Art of the Zoom Holiday PartyI was hired by a new company during the pandemic. I’ve never been to the office, and I’ve only met seven of the company’s 115 employees over Zoom. The company announced a virtual holiday party and game night with karaoke, Pictionary and colleague trivia. I’m not sure I want this to be the first impression most colleagues have of me. But at some companies, holiday parties aren’t really optional. Can I skip it?ou can absolutely skip it! But here’s another idea. At large Zoom parties, most attendees never even know who’s there. (You have to keep scrolling through successive screens of nine people to see who is.) There’s one main conversation and lots of private messaging.How about arriving on the early side, starting private chats with the colleagues you know — plus those you want to know — then leaving as soon as you please? Your colleagues and boss will know you were there, and the odds of public shaming (and catastrophic singing) seem low.What Came in the Mail?I am on the mailings lists of countless direct mail charities. I receive gifts by the pound: pens, self-address labels, coins, even first-class stamps. I have no trouble deciding what to do with these things — use, toss, give away — and they never affect my decision to donate. But lately, I’ve been receiving small checks from charities in the amount of $2, payable to me. They ask me to return their check and send a donation with it. It’s free money! So, why am I reluctant to cash the checks but have no problem pocketing the coins or using the stamps that charities send?he $2 checks are probably meant to grab your attention — wow, right? — or activate some guilty-giving response. But it seems like a poor use of resources (not to mention, environmentally wasteful).As for your reluctance to cash these checks, I get it. The unsolicited pens and stamps simply arrive in the mail. Who would bother to return them? But cashing a check enmeshes you more closely with a charity. And it seems sleazy to take their money, even if that’s what their silly marketing plan deserves.But We Had Plans!We scheduled a Zoom happy hour, days in advance, with close friends we haven’t seen since the pandemic began. (They invited us for socially distant drinks outdoors, but we suggested a Zoom call instead.) Thirty minutes before the call, I got a text saying they had drop-in guests and had to reschedule. I said no problem, even though I’d planned my afternoon around our call. I doubt they would have canceled if our date had been in person. I’m put off. I think Zoom dates are commitments. What should have happened?“Drop-in guests”? (That’s another issue but, nevermind.) I know it feels as if the pandemic has been going on forever, but we’re still learning its protocols. I agree with you: A Zoom date is a commitment. But I also get how your friends may have felt awkward sending away unexpected guests in favor of a conference call.Try not to hold a grudge. When they text to reschedule, tell them you’re really looking forward to seeing them. And, if you feel comfortable doing so, suggest lightly that they shoo away drop-in visitors this time."
41,2020-12-17,"I recently got married. After several changes to our original plans, we had a small, in-person, socially distanced event. We told invited guests that we would also livestream the wedding and that there would be no hard feelings if they decided that was the better choice for them. We outlined the safety protocols of the venue to all invitees. But we still had to ask for firm R.S.V.P.’s like any other wedding. Some guests declined parts of the celebration (after the deadline) and others didn’t show up after saying they would. Every single one of them cited Covid-19 as their reason. I am really hurt by this — especially from our nearest and dearest. How do I move forward with these people?or many of us, invitations from “our nearest and dearest” are more complicated than you may think. It’s great that you offered a streaming option for guests who didn’t feel comfortable going to a wedding during a pandemic. And I’m glad you underscored that guests were free to make their own decision.You still invited them, though. So, without meaning to, you put loved ones in the awkward position of showing up for you on your big day or heeding the warnings of virtually all medical experts who’ve told us not to travel and to socialize only with members of our household. This would be a hard call for some people.I’m sorry you’re hurt. But keep in mind that many guests were probably struggling with their decision (and a worsening pandemic) after your R.S.V.P. deadline. They weren’t being unkind. Just the opposite! Rational people would have sent regrets right away. For now, let’s avoid in-person options until it’s safe to congregate again. It’s more generous to our guests..Christoph NiemannOn Skin Care Evangelism …I am a college student who came home for winter break to discover that my 14-year-old brother’s skin is absolutely awful. He has acne covering his entire face and large patches of eczema around his neck. When my mother picked me up, she warned me not to say anything to him. She bought him face wash and moisturizer and doesn’t think there’s anything else she can do. I told her he should see a dermatologist, which only made her upset. I really want to help my brother, but I don’t know how. Any advice? have no doubt that your brother’s skin is making him feel bad. So, one warning and one piece of advice: When I was your age, I came home from school thinking I knew everything. I was pretty insufferable. I have no reason to believe that’s true of you. Just be careful to respect your mother’s judgment.Ask her: “Is there a reason you’re not taking him to a dermatologist?” If it’s not about the expense (or your brother’s refusal to go), share your concern that his skin condition is probably painful for him. These are tough economic times for many families, though. If that’s true of yours, quietly research free or income-based clinics that may help your brother at reduced cost.… and Small TalkMy husband has a close friend. He often wants me to accompany him on daylong visits to this friend and his wife. He clearly hopes that the wife and I will become close too, but it’s not going to happen. She’s perfectly nice, but we have nothing in common. When I visit, she and I make awkward chitchat and wait for my husband to be ready to leave. When I’ve suggested to my husband that he go alone, he insists that this other couple wants me to come and he would be hurt if I didn’t. Advice?M.It’s magical when two couples really gel, so I understand the triumph of hope over experience for your husband. But you seem to have given this friendship a solid try. Now it’s time to speak with your husband more firmly.Say, “I know you want me to be close with your friend’s wife. We’ve tried, but we don’t connect. You can tell your friend the truth or that you’d prefer to spend time with him alone. But I’m not going to visit anymore.” Then talk it out or compromise a little. Be gentle, but don’t forfeit your autonomy.Plus, How to Say Thanks (Even When You Don’t Mean It)My sister-in-law gave my 16-year-old daughter a hypersexualized blouse that opens to the navel. It’s totally inappropriate, and my daughter was humiliated! How can we let my sister-in-law know that she crossed a line? It’s not a blouse she would buy for her own daughter. Meanwhile, our daughter, who is good about thank-you notes, doesn’t know how to respond. Help!ave you never received a bad (or uncomfortable) gift before? Keep quiet or, if you can be calm about it, say: “Thanks for your gift. I think the blouse is too mature for a teenager, but you were kind to remember her.”And what a great lesson for your daughter: learning to thank people for gifts she doesn’t like, while sincerely acknowledging their generosity."
42,2020-12-24,"My three sisters and I have been doing Secret Santa with our kids for years. Each child picks a cousin’s name. They love exchanging gifts! This year, I told my sisters that my family would not be joining them for Christmas because of Covid but that we’d still like to be part of the Secret Santa. (I could drop off our gifts in advance.) But after following up, I learned that my sisters decided to limit the exchange to cousins who would be there in person. I am hurt that my kids will be excluded and, worse, that my sisters made this decision without discussing it with me. They said the cousins like to watch each other opening gifts, so it made no sense to include my two. Thoughts?ou seem to have scored a hat trick of mean sisters! My main concern here is to avoid hurting your kids by excluding them from a happy family tradition and distancing them from their cousins. Nearly everyone is on Zoom by now. Your sisters should be willing to oblige their virtual participation.Now, Secret Santa assignments have undoubtedly been made already. So, go to your children separately and tell them that they are the other’s Secret Santa. (Shh!) Have them make gifts or drive them to the store quickly. Then call the least icy-hearted of your sisters and tell her you will participate in the Secret Santa by video conference. (If required, explain that you will not have your children’s feelings hurt.)It’s hard to imagine that three adults did not land on this Zoom solution themselves. I hope their decision was not punishment for your wise call to safeguard your family’s health over the holidays. But you can discuss all this with your sisters in the new year. For now, get cracking with your kids! Time is running out..Christoph NiemannSo You’re Calling It a Safety School?I am a college freshman who is at home because of the pandemic. I have a neighbor who walks his dog around the same time I walk mine. We often run into each other. He always asks me where I go to college; he never remembers. When I tell him I go to U.C.L.A., he says, “My daughter got into Stanford, but not U.C.L.A. Isn’t that crazy?” How should I respond to his implication that U.C.L.A. is the worse school?ow rude! Sure, everyone says something thoughtless occasionally. But the fact that your neighbor does it frequently suggests that he’s not listening to you or may be experiencing a bit of early cognitive decline.If you want him to stop, reply: “Did you mean to belittle my school right to my face?” He should remember you after that! But it may be more fun to make up a new college every time he asks and see if he ever notices.It’s Us or ThemMy husband’s sister invited us to a holiday dinner. She said there would be 10 people there, including us. Two of the guests would be teenagers whom we don’t know: a boy who lives with a foster family and his sister who is a resident adviser at a local university. My husband and I are in our 70s and have asthma, so we opted not to attend. My husband called his sister to explain. She understood but felt strongly about including the teenagers. (My husband and I agreed in advance not to ask her to disinvite them.) Still, my sister-in-law never expressed regret or apologized for the situation. Am I right to feel miffed?--’m sorry, but you are decidedly wrong. You and your husband are in your 70s with a known risk factor for serious Covid-related illness. You have no business going to dinner parties until your doctor tells you it is safe to congregate again.And your sister-in-law didn’t spring the teenagers on you after the fact. They were always on her kindhearted-but-probably-ill-advised guest list. Two takeaways here: We don’t get to tell other people whom to invite. And stay home! Thousands of people are dying every day; there’s no reason to risk it.Just Tell Me What You Want!During December, I ask family members what they want for Christmas. Most respond eventually, but some don’t. For them, I put forth minimal effort. (Think: Starbucks gift cards.) My mom says I should try harder to consider what they want. But I’ve got a job and two kids. I don’t feel like researching gifts for halfhearted thanks later. Am I the Grinch?A.Quite possibly! Many people (over the age of 16) would feel awkward telling others what to buy for them. And I don’t think your mother is suggesting that you go to a silent retreat to contemplate your gifts, only that you spend a few minutes thinking about them.Are these relatives readers, foodies, committed to a charitable cause? It won’t take long to match gifts to their interests. If your heart isn’t in it, maybe it’s time to tell them that you’d like to stop exchanging gifts. You’re allowed!"
43,2020-12-31,"Many years ago, my sister married a young politician whose views are very different from hers and mine. I talked to her about it; she said they were good at compartmentalizing. Over time, his positions grew worse. He spent last year, for instance, downplaying Covid-19 and ignoring safety precautions. (I don’t know what compartment my sister put that in!) Now I’ve learned he took a Covid vaccine when legislators were offered them. He is not a health care worker, elderly or at risk. People could die because of his selfishness! How can I talk to my sister about this? I love her, but I can’t take it anymore. get your frustration at watching coronavirus deniers receive vaccines before many frontline workers and others at high risk. But this is about your sister, right? Do you really think that, after “many years,” she has any doubt that you disagree with her husband’s politics? She wasn’t the architect of the program that offered early vaccines to certain officials to ensure continuity of government.So, what do you hope to accomplish here? Nothing you say to your sister is going to influence her husband’s views. Lashing out at her about him may make you feel better for a second, but it won’t change much (besides alienating her). Even a more subtle critique — that she is complicit with him — is unlikely to have an effect. Putting people on the defensive rarely does.Here’s my (challenging) advice: Peel away your brother-in-law’s politics from your sister and approach her with love. No criticism, just support. When she feels safe, she may begin to confide in you about any ambivalence she feels. Then you can engage her gently. Maybe you’ll understand her better. But if you want to slam her husband, save your breath..Christoph NiemannFinders Keepers?I found two gift cards from a department store on the ground while I was out walking. I discovered they have a combined balance of $440. I asked customer service if the cards could be traced to their purchaser or recipient, but the representative said no. Should I go ahead and use them or perhaps pay them forward in some other way? The money’s already been spent to buy them.A.M.Doesn’t it seem strange that people are still willing to plunk down good money for gift cards that aren’t linked to them or their recipients in the utterly predictable case of loss? They’re just cash with a veneer of security.Assuming the cards can’t be traced, here’s a two-step suggestion: Wait a month. It’s possible that the buyer of the gift cards will bring proof of purchase to the department store and argue successfully for replacement cards, voiding the ones you now hold.After that, though, if there is still $440 on the cards, call your local homeless shelter or food pantry and ask what the organization needs that you could buy at the department store. Then use the cards to do it. If you want a personal reward for your trouble, make it a small one. These are painful times for so many.I Thought I Said ‘No Gifts’On Giving Tuesday, I sent an email to close friends requesting no gifts this year. I welcomed donations to my favorite charity instead. One friend replied that her gift was already on its way: a Facebook Portal, a video calling device. But she knew that I had deleted Facebook over privacy concerns and its failure to curb misinformation. The last thing I want to do is help Facebook grow bigger! Still, my friend has asked me several times to set up the device so we can video chat. I shared my concerns and offered to send the gift to any of her friends who might enjoy it. Now she’s upset with me. Advice?M.Normally, there is no reason to share anything but delight at our friends’ gifts. I respect your objections here, though. So, circle back to your friend and apologize for not thanking her sufficiently for her gift — even if you thanked her plenty. Clearly, that wasn’t her takeaway. You don’t have to install Facebook again or use the device, but make sure your friend knows you’re grateful for her generosity and for thinking of you.Yes, I Know (Obviously)I stay up-to-the-minute on news and pop culture events (probably to the detriment of my mental health). What should I do when a friend starts telling me a long story about some current event that I’m well aware of? Is there a polite way to say: “Yes, I know about that already”? I don’t want to seem like a know-it-all.T.L.There’s nothing rude about breaking in gently when friends start recounting a story we already know. The awkward part is snatching the conversation away from them, mid-speech, and hanging onto it.Avoid this problem by saying: “Yes, I saw that. What do you make of it?” You skip the summary of the story you already know but return the mic quickly to your friends so they can take the conversation wherever it is they intended to."
44,2021-01-07,"I went to pick up my child from a school activity. (The kids are masked and grouped in small pods.) While waiting, my friend approached my car. She was obviously tipsy; even my younger child noticed how oddly she spoke and acted. I know she has a history of problem drinking. She’s also going through a contentious divorce and custody dispute. I didn’t say anything to her about driving with her child in the car, which I now regret. (She can be loud and aggressive.) I worry about her, her kids and how her drinking may jeopardize her custody battle. My husband and I have moved our child’s activity so we won’t have to deal with this again. Is there anything else I can do?our friend sounds messy. Two notes of caution, though: You say she was “obviously tipsy,” but do you know that for sure? (It’s important to get the facts straight here.) If you’re right, changing your child’s schedule is no solution. This woman is still driving her child, and herself, under the influence.I think you have a duty to intervene. Keep it focused on what you saw. You may not have firsthand knowledge of her past drinking, divorce or custody dispute. But you watched her child get into her car while you believe she was drunk.If you witness this behavior again, say matter-of-factly: “You seem to have had too much to drink. I’ll drive you both home, and you can pick up your car tomorrow.” If she resists, tell her: “I won’t have your child’s safety on my conscience.” If she continues to refuse, you may threaten to call the police, but let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.You can still talk to her about the earlier incident. (I hope you will!) But focus on the specific episode, not her life challenges: She poses a danger to her child and to others if she drives under the influence. You may still decide to report your suspicions. But now, after the fact and without proof, it’s unlikely to accomplish much.For people struggling with drugs and alcohol, here are some resources (almost all of which are free.).Christoph NiemannThe Covid Police Next DoorI am on good terms with my neighbor. We exchanged nice texts over the holidays. Three days later, she texted again, asking me to confirm that we had conformed to our state’s quarantine rule for out-of-state visitors. I have no idea why she thought we hadn’t. (My daughter’s car has out-of-state license plates, but she’s been here for months.) I was offended by her text, so I ignored it. She texted the next day saying she assumed we hadn’t complied since I hadn’t responded. I texted back that I hadn’t replied because I thought she was out of line. We went back and forth like this until she said she was blocking my number. Is there a way to rehabilitate this relationship?s Americans, we prize our personal freedoms: “It’s nobody’s business what I do in my home!” But for many, the pandemic has brought into clearer focus our obligations to each other. Isn’t it the abdication of responsibility to others that’s so galling about people ignoring safety recommendations?Your neighbor may be nosy, judgmental or terribly frightened. (I have no way of knowing.) Rather than standing on principle, though, why not call and reassure her: “Of course we abided by safety protocols! Are you all right?” Hundreds of thousands of our neighbors have died. It would be totally normal if she’s not !Gift, InterruptedI spoke with my sister about a Hanukkah gift for my nephew, who is 14. I went with her recommendation. After Hanukkah passed, I never heard from him. When I asked my sister if he got my gift card, she told me she had rolled it into a larger gift from me and his toddler cousins that she planned to give him on Christmas. Shouldn’t I have been told about this in advance?ho gives gifts from toddlers? Of course you should have been told. But here’s another thought: If you don’t know what your teenage nephew might like for Hanukkah, talk or text with him directly.That way, you build your own relationship with him instead of using your sister as a go-between. This will make it more natural for him to thank you for your gifts and to talk with you generally. Win-win!In This Economy?I work as an executive assistant at a prestigious management consulting firm. In October, one of my bosses was elected senior partner, for which he generously and unexpectedly gave me a cash gift of $1,000 to thank me for my hard work. Usually, he gives me a year-end gift of $2,000, but he didn’t this year. So, did he forget, or does he think the October gift was adequate? I am disappointed and rather bitter. May I say something? wouldn’t. I bet 2020 was a weird year for holiday gifts and tips. And unlike your salary, your boss’s gifts are purely discretionary. If you’re dissatisfied with your pay, speak up. But we’re never entitled to gifts, even after we’ve gotten used to receiving them. Sorry!"
45,2021-01-14,"My sister is married to a great guy with a successful military career. He has supported her through diagnoses of mental illness and cancer. But my sister does many frustrating things: She hoards food, feeds her kids junk (they’re obese) and allowed her son to fail a grade in school by letting him stay home and play video games all day while his father was deployed. If anyone talks to my sister in a way she finds remotely critical, she stonewalls that person for days. Her husband is morally opposed to divorce, but I worry about his happiness. In order to maintain a relationship with my sister, I have to pretend everything she does is . Please help!ou have been fairly meticulous about cataloging your sister’s failures and flaws. But I don’t see a word about your efforts to support her — only a concern for her husband’s happiness as your sister struggles. If her husband is home again, he bears as much as responsibility as your sister for raising their children. And if he is still deployed, she could probably use a hand.What you fail to acknowledge here is that many mental illnesses and cancer treatments are debilitating and exhausting. Trying to manage them while raising children may be pushing your sister to the brink. The last thing she needs from you is any criticism.Instead, organize a circle of supportive friends and relatives to lift her up. Offer to shop and make dinner for the family occasionally. Give the kids a ride to school or help with their homework. With a more manageable load, your sister may be open to tackling the issues you raise in your letter — perhaps with the help of a therapist..Christoph NiemannParty FoulMy fiancé and I had a New Year’s Eve party with a small pod of friends we’ve seen frequently during the pandemic. It was a great night and all the more special because we hosted it at our new house. The morning after, though, we discovered our new off-white sofa was covered in clothing dye. After some investigation, we are certain it was from a friend’s black dress. We hired an upholstery cleaner, but the dye is still visible. Fortunately, there is another solution: For $800, we can buy three new sofa cushion covers. Would it be rude to ask our friend to cover this cost?ne of the few certainties in giving parties is that accidents can happen. So, let me offer a script for mishaps-while-hosting that you may find unfair at first, but that has served me well for many years.Call your friend to let her know what happened. Along with her apologies and a possible vow to retire that dress, she may offer to cover your cleaning costs. (Don’t mention the failed cleaning attempt or imminent cushion replacement.) Thank her for her kind offer, but refuse it. If she insists, use my mother’s effective line: “It would hurt me for you to pay me.” That should settle the issue.True hospitality — making friends comfortable in our homes — often requires shrugging off accidental damage. That’s what makes it so hard and precious. (On a practical note: Before you replace your white cushion covers, get an estimate for having some made in a nice indoor/outdoor fabric. It’s more durable and often stain resistant.)Access DeniedMy husband and I are hoping to have a child soon. I am politically liberal, and he is conservative. We are both tolerant. But we have some family and friends who are right-wing conspiracy theorists. After learning that many of them still hold their extreme views after the events in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, I would be more comfortable if my child were never exposed to them. How do I tell these people they will not meet my child because of their views?A.Listen, I get revenge fantasies as well as the next person. (And the assault on our democracy has been frightening to watch.) But you’re asking about blocking access to a child who doesn’t exist yet because of political views that may change over time. I suggest choreographing your rejections later.For now, make sure that you and your husband agree on the principles that will govern your future child’s world. As long as you two are on the same page, working out how to deal with extended family will be a challenge you can manage together.Not Even a ‘Happy Birthday’?Because of the pandemic, my 19-year-old son stayed on his college campus for winter break. He forgot my birthday, which upset me more than I would have thought. It’s not like I expected a gift, just an acknowledgment. Would it be too much of a guilt trip to say something?ineteen is old enough to understand the hurt that carelessness can cause. Say, “Honey, you forgot my birthday, and it hurt my feelings. Will you try to remember next year? A call or card would mean a lot to me.” I bet he will — especially if you tell him to put the date in his calendar."
46,2021-01-21,"My half sister got engaged recently and, because of the pandemic, decided to elope. When she told our dad about her plans, all hell broke loose! He wanted her to wait and have a big, beautiful wedding. Three months after her elopement, he is still upset and hurt. As a family, we’ve tried to tell him to get over it: “There’s a pandemic.” “This is not about you, Dad.” “We’ll have a celebration later.” Nothing helps. They even had a family counseling session that didn’t go well. My dad wants an apology and thinks my sister should have changed her plans after learning his view. We’re all losing patience with him, and I’m worried about the damage he’s causing to relationships. Any advice?t would be terrific if other people’s hurt feelings could be repaired on our timetable — and even better if telling people who are upset to “get over it” did anything but make them more upset. People heal on their own schedules. Still, props to your family for trying.It sounds as if your sister explained to your father why she chose an elopement during a pandemic and that there will be time for a lovely reception when it’s safe. What I’m missing here is the reason for your father’s distress: Is he upset at being excluded from your sister’s private ceremony or missing the bells and whistles of a big event? Sometimes, exploring hurt feelings more deeply can help heal them.If your father simply wants to call the shots, though, or control your sister, you will all have to wait him out. And in that case, everyone should stop catering to his distress. Making people’s unyielding selfishness the center of attention can often create more of it..Christoph NiemannOffensiveness, RankedAs a Christian, I find it hurtful when I hear the Lord’s name used as swear words. If I used sexist, racist, anti-Semitic or homophobic language as curse words, I might be garroted. So, it’s hard for me to understand why such swearing is acceptable when it comes to Christ. But the idea of confronting people about this makes me uneasy. Is there a better way to communicate my hurt?ou undermined my sympathy for your question by presenting it as a false choice between demeaning Jesus Christ and using hateful epithets about the identities of living people. Neither is acceptable! But linking them unnecessarily, as you have, suggests that your real grievance is about how offensiveness is ranked.Limit your complaints about swearing to people you know. (Who can say how angry strangers may react?) After your friends have cooled down, say calmly: “It upsets me to hear the Lord’s name used as a profanity. Can you find another one, please?” That should do the trick.Pet Parent Parity?My husband and I have two dogs. He walks them several times a day, and I usually join him for the bedtime stroll. The issue: When it’s raining, I see no reason for both of us to get wet. I’ve told him: “Either I’ll walk the dogs or you can, but there’s no reason for both of us to do it.” But he thinks it’s not fair if he gets wet and I don’t. (He’s actually told me it wasn’t raining when it was just so I would go with him.) Help!nless there’s a reason for your husband to doubt your willingness to walk the dogs in the rain without him, this is a head-scratcher. The next time it’s raining, put on your rain gear and take the dogs out for their evening walk alone. This will assure your husband of your sincerity.After that, take turns walking the dogs in bad weather. Make sure, too, that your husband’s insistence that you get wet isn’t really a complaint: Ask if he is satisfied with the division of dog care responsibilities.The Price of ShippingSeveral months ago, our friend and neighbor flew across the country to be with her ailing mother. Unfortunately, her mother passed away during the visit. So, our neighbor telephoned and asked us to ship some clothes that would be appropriate for a funeral by overnight mail. (We’d exchanged house keys for emergency use.) She said she would reimburse us for the shipping cost. My wife selected the clothes, and I took them to  and paid $147 to ship them. But, apparently, the thought of reimbursing us hasn’t occurred to her since she returned home. Should I remind her, or write off her debt?ersonally, I would let this go as a gesture of good will between neighbors. If you feel differently, though, remind her about it. Say, “I still have the receipt for the clothes we shipped to you for your mother’s funeral. It came to $147.”The only thing I ask is that you try to tamp down feeling “miffed” before you talk to her. Losing a parent is a big deal, and all sorts of details can get lost in the grief. That’s no disrespect to you or the kindness you showed your neighbor."
47,2021-01-28,"I live with my wife and our 11-year-old son in a peaceful suburban community. Given the civil unrest that shook our nation’s capital recently, and the continuing threat of violence elsewhere, my wife is fearful and would like to buy a gun for protection. She believes that unrest threatens us personally. I disagree. I think the presence of a gun in the home markedly increases the risk of someone being shot. I am also skeptical of marauding bands in our neighborhood. Any thoughts about our conflict?y father killed himself with a gun he kept in our home, so I have a million thoughts about owning firearms. First, though, let me ask an important question: Have you and your wife discussed the responsibilities of gun ownership? (It may sound simple, but it’s actually a lot of work.)It requires foolproof storage of the weapon, preferably in a locked gun safe with the ammunition housed separately; instruction for you and your wife in using the gun safely; and absolute certainty that your child will not get his hands on it. Let me add: There is no room for error in any of this!Studies show that guns in homes increase the likelihood of domestic homicide and suicide. And defending yourselves from lawless mobs seems improbable to me. Still, I get your wife’s fear. The attack on the Capitol was terrifying, and subsequent reports may have increased anyone’s anxiety. Perhaps, though, by exploring other security measures (better locks, for instance, or an alarm system) your wife may agree that the kneejerk purchase of a gun is unwise..Christoph NiemannEnough Already!I am in my late 40s, and dating is challenging. Recently, I met a man who is smart, kind and attentive. Most important, he laughs at my jokes! The issue: He has no sense of other people’s time. He can talk on the phone for hours. And he has to be kind of pushed out the door at the end of our socially distanced dates. I love that he enjoys my company, but maybe his behavior is a sign of neediness or a social radar deficit? He told me his sibling sets time limits on their visits. Any advice?o, your new boyfriend has a problem ending calls and dates on your timetable. And maybe an issue with boundaries. But from what you’ve written here, it doesn’t seem as if you’ve mentioned the problem to him. I understand the fantasy of being wordlessly in sync with a romantic partner. Has that ever worked for you before?Why not be direct? Until you’ve told him you are uncomfortable with his behavior, I am not much interested in stories about his sibling or your unsupported diagnoses of neediness or “social radar deficit.” You’ve met a lovely guy, you say. Now, communicate with him. That’s the whole ballgame!To Respond, or Not to Respond?I help with graphic design and marketing at a nonprofit organization that does good work in our community. Occasionally, the executive director forwards me a racist reply she’s received to an email blast or survey I helped generate. Most recently, this happened after a Martin Luther King Day mailing. I would like to reply with angry emails to these bigots. But the executive director has expressed safety concerns and refuses to send anything back to them. Is there a better way to handle this? assume the fund-raising requests and surveys the organization sends are unsolicited. Typically, the purpose of blind mailings is to identify potential supporters and to create an effective master list for the organization.It is reprehensible that some people respond with racist messages. But your emails are spam. And further communication with angry strangers is unlikely to lead to productive dialogue or financial support. I suggest removing their names from your master list and getting on with the good work of the organization.You Don’t Pay Rent on the HallwayI recently moved into a studio apartment. There are three other units on my floor, and the occupants of two of them leave their shoes outside their doors. I find this bizarre and disgusting! It’s not a matter of space. Each unit has an absurd number of closets. I can understand leaving muddy shoes or sopping umbrellas in the hall, but I think personal belongings belong inside. Should I introduce myself and ask what’s up, or just get over it? plead guilty! And I think you’re onto something with the examples of muddy shoes and dripping umbrellas. I don’t like tracking anything from the sidewalk into my apartment, so I take off my shoes before entering and place them (tidily) on my welcome mat.You make a fair point about leaving personal items in shared hallways, though. If I received a pleasant note from you asking me to take my shoes inside, I would do it. I would probably also feel annoyed with you for a while. (Are my shoes really that annoying?) So, your call!"
48,2021-02-04,"My sisters and I were raised by a mother who gave us money, jewelry and other gifts based on which of us was her favorite at the moment. Sometimes, she asked for gifts back so she could give them to a different child. This created unhealthy competition among my sisters and me; we rarely see each other now. My husband and I have three children, who are now adults, and we’ve always been careful to treat them equally. So, I am troubled that one of my sisters recently made a large cash gift to my eldest daughter, who is a doctor, and gave nothing to my younger children who earn less. It reminds me of my painful childhood. Should I speak to my sister, or let this go?t’s not easy to change ingrained family dynamics — even hurtful ones. So, I admire your dedication to raising your children with a more evenhanded approach to gifts. Here’s the problem, though: The outside world is not bound to adhere to your rules. And your kids are adults now; they’re not entitled to presents from their aunt (though she can give them as she pleases).You don’t describe your sister’s relationships with your children. Isn’t it more likely that there’s a reason for her gift than that she randomly resuscitated a trick from your mother’s playbook? Maybe your eldest daughter calls and visits more often. That would explain it.Don’t raise the issue with your sister unless you’re prepared to rehash the dynamics of your childhood. Check in with your kids instead. Ask how they feel about this. You may be surprised to learn that the care you took in treating them equally will pay off now when others don’t..Christoph NiemannFriend or Foe?My neighbor bought a brand-new Range Rover that costs $150,000. She used to drive a Chevy Suburban and rarely waved when she passed. But now that she’s got new wheels, she goes out of her way to let you know she’s there: waving and eye contact. I find her self-boosting unfortunate and annoying when so many people are unemployed and struggling. What would you do?M.It’s entirely possible that your neighbor is a materialistic braggart who is waving to draw attention to her fancy new car. It’s also possible that you are plagued more by envy of her than by concern for the unemployed and struggling.Let me play Pollyanna: Ever since we went into pandemic seclusion, I’ve been much friendlier to people on the street, waving and sometimes even speaking to strangers as I pass. (Don’t worry: from a distance!) It stems from a pent-up desire to connect, not a wish for anyone to admire my chic new parka. I would wave back at your neighbor.A House Divided Over VaccinesMy husband and I are over 75-years-old with risk factors for serious illness if we’re infected with Covid-19. Soon, I will receive the second shot of my two-dose vaccination. But my husband was raised to be distrustful of vaccines, and he refuses to be vaccinated. I don’t expect his attitude to change. I look forward to vacations and visits with family and friends after my immunity builds. I’m sure my husband will want to join me, but he will still be at risk. What should I do? (My son tells me his father made his choice, and it’s not my responsibility. I’m not so sure.) disagree with your son. And I suspect it would be cold comfort to you that your husband “made his choice” if he were to become seriously ill. Historically, mistrust of vaccines is not uncommon. (Conspiracy theories and increased political polarization seem to be driving more suspicion.) But that should be the starting point here, not your conclusion.Reach out to your doctor or any knowledgeable person whom your husband trusts. Share his reluctance to be vaccinated and ask for help. A conversation with the right person may help change your husband’s mind. In the meantime, stay put (or leave your husband at home)! He still poses a health risk not only to himself but to others who have not yet been offered the vaccine.Feeling Like an AfterthoughtMy husband’s assistant of eight years sent a thank-you note to him for a holiday gift she knows I bought. Usually, she thanks me by phone or email. This year, she addressed a written thank-you note to my husband with my name in parentheses. She didn’t thank me directly. I feel slighted by this. Leave my name off, but don’t put me in parentheses! Is it worth bringing this up?’m sympathetic with everyone here (except your husband). You bought a gift for him to give to his assistant. If there was a card attached, it was probably signed in his name, not yours. And so his assistant made a clumsy effort to recognize (parenthetically) the unspoken truth of the gift’s origin. Let this go. If you want to be thanked, sign your name on the card with your husband’s next year."
49,2021-02-11,"My son and his fiancée are getting married in September. We’re all excited! The problem: We created two guest lists, one of close friends and relatives who will definitely be invited and another of those we would like to include, but who won’t receive invitations until we have a better sense of acceptance numbers. Unfortunately, the bridal couple mailed save-the-date cards to both groups. We’re hoping that Covid will no longer prevent large gatherings by the wedding date, but there is a limit on the number of guests the venue holds. Is there a graceful way not to invite people who received save-the-date cards in error?’S e all make mistakes. (And we’re certainly rusty with parties.) Before turning to the couple’s mishap, though, let me flag the bigger issue here: It’s a bit optimistic to be setting dates for large gatherings now. Yes, we’ve had promising news about Covid vaccines, and many states have allowed large weddings, but the pandemic is far from over. We don’t know how it will progress or when it will be safe to congregate again.A September wedding likely means an August R.S.V.P. date. (You’ll need time to chase late responders and mail the next wave of invitations.) If your guests plan to be vaccinated before they attend large gatherings, that timing seems too aggressive based on current rates. Plus, we don’t yet know that vaccination stops community spread.I hate to be a downer! Prepare yourself, though, for the likelihood that many invitees will decline your invitation, citing safety concerns. (That may hurt your feelings.) Others may accept, then change their minds later when reality hits. (Annoying!) And some unvaccinated guests may attend because they feel guilty not coming after saying they would.Now, as for your question: It is unkind not to invite people whom you’ve asked to save the date. You may have room for everyone if the acceptance rate is low enough. But the better solution is to postpone the large wedding now and wait to set a new date until after the C.D.C. tells us that big parties are safe and how to conduct them..Christoph NiemannHere’s a New OneMy husband always went to a barber who also took care of his ear hair. Since the pandemic began, my husband trims his own hair and ignores his ears. I told him he looks unkempt, but he waved me away with “men have hairy ears.” So, I bought him a trimmer which has gone unused. I think it’s important we try to look nice for each other, and I can’t stand his disregard for my feelings. Am I wrong?any of us are amateur aestheticians now. (As Whitney Houston sang: “It’s not right, but it’s .”) Perhaps your husband really doesn’t care about ear hair, or maybe he’s terrified to insert a small weed whacker into his tender ear canal.Why not offer to help him? Problem solved! If you’d rather not, or if he refuses, let this go. His control over his body is more important than your judgments about it. He’ll be going back to the barber eventually, right?No Food Talk at the Dinner TableI frequently share meals (safely) with an old friend who critiques how much I eat. If I finish my meal, she says, “Well, you certainly enjoyed that!” She, herself, eats small portions and usually leaves half her meal on her plate. She’s thin, and while my weight is normal, I take her statements as implicit criticism. What should I do?peak up! Unless your friend is mean — in which case, why are you dining with her so frequently? — she may have no idea that she’s hurting your feelings. Her comment, a common one, may be just a habit or verbal tic.The next time she does it, say, “It makes me feel self-conscious when you comment about how much I’ve eaten. Please don’t.” I bet she’ll be happy to oblige you and wish you’d spoken sooner. It may even lead to an interesting conversation.Finders Keepers?My mother-in-law died recently, and my husband and I have been spending evenings and weekends going through her things. It’s a lot of work! I found a silver candlestick with a note from a deceased cousin: Apparently, the candlestick is part of the family’s immigration story, and the cousin asked that it be kept in the family. My husband plans to call around to see who wants it. But I think I deserve it. I’m family, and I found it. I want to sell it and use the money to refurbish my flute. Thoughts?his candlestick is a family heirloom, not $20 you found in the pocket of an overcoat. You are indeed part of the family by marriage, and assuming the candlestick is not conveyed to someone else in your mother-in-law’s will or by the laws of succession, you and your husband may have a reasonable claim to it. (Finders keepers does not govern here.) Selling it, though, would be disrespectful to the wishes of your husband’s cousin and his family."
50,2021-02-18,"My brother, who is a health care provider, qualified for the Covid vaccine. He also got his wife vaccinated by putting her on his office payroll temporarily and claiming that she is a health care worker too. (She is not!) I’m not sure which is worse: playing the system or gleefully bragging about it in a text he sent around after they had both been vaccinated. Other relatives won’t be vaccinated for months, though their risk of illness is greater. I ignored my brother’s text when he sent it. What should I say when I speak to him?or as long as I’ve understood rules — about sharing toys as a kid, paying taxes to the I.R.S. or qualifying for Covid vaccines — I have known people who take pleasure (and advantage) in violating the spirit of rules while technically complying with them. Meet your brother!His payroll trick may have made his wife eligible for a vaccine by the letter of the guidelines, even if she never went near a patient. They gamed the system for a few months’ head start on vaccination for her. And you’re right: They did it at the expense of others at greater risk.Are you honestly surprised by their behavior, though, after nearly a year of watching neighbors advertise their indifference to the welfare of others — by refusing to wear masks, for instance? Sure, you may tell your brother you don’t respect his selfish actions. But to what end? He’s a health care worker! He knew the vaccine grab was wrong and did it anyway. Now you know him and your sister-in-law better..Christoph NiemannLoose EndsTwo years ago, my husband and I were friends with another couple. I watched my husband’s relationship with the wife become flirtatious. They also started spending time alone together. I confronted my husband with what looked like the beginning of an affair. We dealt with the fallout, and I forgave him after he apologized. I also confronted the wife, who admitted eventually that the relationship was inappropriate. We never spoke again. But our husbands remain friendly. (Her husband forgave them both.) I still feel a pit in my stomach when I see her or when my husband sees his friend. I probably would have forgiven her if she’d apologized. But she didn’t. Should I ask for an apology? I’d hate to interfere with my husband’s friendship.onogamy isn’t easy. (How’s that for understatement?) The only person who wronged you, though, is your husband. The other wife was a bad friend, but she’d made no commitment to you. I would be wary of reintroducing this couple to your marriage, and I would give up on an apology by the wife. She’s had two years to tell you she’s sorry, and she hasn’t done it.You deserve to be free from pits in your stomach! Share your discomfort with your husband and suggest that both of you take a break from this couple. He should understand. It’s a reasonable consequence of his behavior. If he doesn’t, this would make a good subject for marriage counseling.Woof!A lovely family just moved next door. They have a fenced yard and a large dog. Every morning, they let the dog out at the crack of dawn, and he barks incessantly. We’re working from home, and the barking often wakes us. We don’t want to start off on the wrong foot with these people. What should we do?y amateur diagnosis (based solely on years of dog ownership) is that the dog may be suffering from separation anxiety at being shut out of the house on his own.Call your neighbors and say (nicely), “We don’t want to be difficult, but your dog’s barking is waking us when you put him out early in the morning. Can you stay with him while he does his business? He may be less likely to bark that way.” That shouldn’t raise many hackles. A good night’s sleep is worth an awkward chat (or three).Driver’s License PendingMy daughter turned 15 recently. She is excited to start driving, but state law requires drivers to be 16 years old for a license or learner’s permit. The problem: She has a friend whose parents let the girl start driving on her own when she was 14. We doubted it, then saw for ourselves it’s true! She takes her older sister’s license with her when she drives. Should we let our daughter practice driving on neighborhood streets or discourage her friendship with this girl?M.Isn’t it odd that we need a license to drive but not to raise children? It would be reckless and illegal for you to allow your daughter to drive without a license. You would also be teaching her that she is above the law. Bad all around!Separating the girls doesn’t fix the problem. Wouldn’t it be more sensible to confirm that the girl’s parents really do know she’s driving? (I hope they don’t!) You may also call the police. An official visit may stop the illegal driving (and save the girl from getting a ticket — or worse — if she gets caught). But I’d start with the parents."
51,2021-02-25,"I was remarried two years ago to a caring and considerate man. He moved into my home with my two kids (who are now away at college). When he arrived, he subtly let me know that he didn’t expect to pay any household expenses. I work part-time and have some family money, but I’m still on a budget. I didn’t mind paying for everything until the pandemic hit. Now, I’ve lost my job and my investments have taken a hit, so my finances are tight. I’ve brought up my situation several times, but my husband says things are tight for him too. (Our incomes are about the same.) I can’t help feeling hurt and resentful. He knows this, but he does nothing. Any advice?’m confused. Unless you left out a crucial detail — your husband does all the cooking and cleaning, for instance, or performs most of the emotional labor in your relationship — the man you describe as “caring and considerate” sounds like a freeloader. It’s time for you to take it up a notch.When we live with other people (much less marry them), there’s no room for subtlety about household expenses. The bills must be paid! It doesn’t sound as if you’ve made a direct request of your husband, though. Stop hinting and tell him what you think a fair division of expenses would be. Then listen to his response.Now, I can understand if he’s reluctant to divide all the bills in half. You set up an infrastructure for two kids. He’s not responsible for them. But there’s no good argument for his paying nothing toward housing, food and maintenance costs. An honest conversation should stop this gravy train or at least reveal what your husband is thinking. You’ll never solve this problem without knowing that..Christoph NiemannDon’t I Have a Right to Know?I recently made an appointment at a new dental clinic. While I was on the phone, I asked the receptionist if the dentists and hygienists had received Covid-19 vaccinations yet. She told me she couldn’t answer my question; it was personal information. But I think it’s reasonable to ask. I’m not sure I’m comfortable going to a clinic where workers (who will be in close contact with me) haven’t been vaccinated. Thoughts? agree with you — even though we’re not being entirely rational. We are still waiting for clinical studies to show whether vaccinated people can spread the virus to others. So, vaccinated or not, your dentist should be masked and gloved during your appointment. (You can certainly call back to verify safety protocols at the clinic.)Still, after medical and dental workers were (rightly) prioritized as among the first recipients of the Covid vaccine, it seems only fair of them to share whatever peace of mind we may take from their vaccination as we sit open-mouthed before them.Now, I am not a medical ethicist. And I expect we will hear more privacy arguments in the coming months. As an anecdotal matter, I’ve felt super safe with the safety measures my health care providers have established. If you’re uneasy, though, cancel your appointment and find a more forthcoming dentist. Better yet, unless your procedure is an emergency, wait until you’ve been vaccinated to reschedule.Matters of PunctuationI hyphenate my last name. I feel lost without seeing that hyphen between my surname and my husband’s: Jane Doe-Deer. What is the etiquette of addressing invitations to my husband and me? Should it be Mr. and Mrs. John Deer? Or Mr. and Mrs. John Doe-Deer? (My husband doesn’t hyphenate his surname.)hink of etiquette as a flurry of rules to help us be nicer to each other. To me, it’s bad manners to call people names they don’t like or that may hurt them. I would not exclude your first name from invitations to you and your husband, for instance, just because our grandparents did it that way. You are not subsumed by him!I wouldn’t use “Mrs.,” either. Men are not identified as married or unmarried on addresses. Why should you be? Now consider people who are nonbinary. Why disrespect them with the wrong title? So, here’s how I’d address an invitation to you and your husband: “John Deer and Jane Doe-Deer.” What do you think?Prying EyesI live in a condominium where many residents have a direct view of my comings and goings. They can see when I’m home by looking out their windows to check my reserved parking spot. When I’m away, they often ask (by text) to borrow my spot for their visitors. Or they want to know where I am. Or why I’m away during a pandemic. I find this annoying. I’m happy to chat briefly with my neighbors, but I like my privacy. What say you?B.A succession of quick refusals should fix this problem in short order. When neighbors ask to borrow your parking spot, reply: “That won’t be convenient.” When they ask where you are, respond: “I’m taking care of some personal business.”Even the most persistent of them will be discouraged eventually. And curtness will probably serve you better than trying to illustrate the boundaries of acceptable questions to tenacious neighbors."
52,2021-03-04,"I am a queer high school senior and the daughter of evangelical Christians. I have kept my sexuality secret from them. During the pandemic, I got lonely, so I started chatting on L.G.B.T.Q. message boards. Unfortunately, I was careless with my browser history. My mother saw it and freaked out. She made me swear I’m not a lesbian. I did. My parents are also making me talk to their minister every week. If I don’t, they say I will have to leave home. They also threatened not to help with college costs next year. (They’re not kidding.) So, now I’m lying to their minister too. I hate this! I like to think of myself as a good person. Should I come clean?ight now, when the power differential between you and your parents is so great and the threatened consequences of honesty may harm you so badly (and unfairly), the truth is a luxury you can’t afford. Keep lying! You are not a bad person.You are trying to survive your parents’ bigotry over an immutable part of your identity. For now, focus on safety: keeping a roof over your head and staying in school. When you are able to support yourself, decide how forthcoming you want to be with your parents. (Their views may change.)Remember: You didn’t choose any of this. And self-preservation is nothing to be ashamed of. Over time, you will see that heartbreaking numbers of L.G.B.T.Q. young people are forced into the same nasty bind as you. Look after yourself and keep an eye out for people whom you can talk to safely. If I can help, please get back in touch..Christoph NiemannWritten in the StarsI received an email asking me to rate customer service at my car dealership. My experience has not been good. Despite our state’s mask mandate, many people do not wear masks indoors, including public-facing staff and other customers. When I spoke to the manager, he first said I was mistaken. Then he said he was unwilling to confront customers about masks. I gave the dealership one of five stars and explained why. Now, the manager has asked me to change my rating. He said my review will cause him to face a pay cut next month that he can’t afford. He told me I will receive another email asking me to rescore the dealership. What should I do?efore we get to the manager, let me take a swipe at the dealership’s ridiculous, albeit common, practice of reaching out to reviewers. The point of customer surveys is to assess and improve service, not to hassle customers over their honest responses. Don’t change a word!Now, as for the manager, he seems to want it both ways: He refuses to ask customers or employees to wear masks (though he could do so easily by referring to your state’s mask mandate). And he wants you to bear needless health risks silently. I’m sympathetic to the new challenges of service jobs. But this manager is way off base. Maybe a financial hit will encourage him to rethink his approach.‘Young Lady’? Really?I just turned 67 and feel pretty good about myself. I look like a healthy older woman. So, why do men smirk when they open doors for me and say things like: “Here you go, young lady”? Do they think I don’t own a calendar or a mirror? The last time it happened, I felt terrible about myself for hours. How to respond?our encounters are so steeped in sexism and ageism that I doubt a snappy comeback will help you much. It’s galling that these men feel entitled to comment on your age, albeit in cutesy fashion. But the fact that you give male strangers the power to make you feel bad about yourself “for hours” is equally disheartening.The next time this happens, be straightforward: “You realize you’re calling me ‘old’ by calling me ‘young lady,’ right? I bet you don’t do that to men.” But your bigger takeaway, I hope, will be that the only person whose opinion about your appearance matters is you!Tipping the TeacherMy youngest grandchild is bright and loving, but he struggles at school. At 6, he sometimes hits other children and has tantrums. His parents and teacher are working hard with him. But I learned recently that his parents give his public-school teacher a monthly cash gift because my son doesn’t think teachers earn enough. Is this right?our son’s heart is in the right place. Most public-school teachers are underpaid. Still, most districts have rules about gifts to teachers. And there are good reasons for these rules: Parents shouldn’t feel pressured to give, and teachers shouldn’t feel bribed.Let’s assume, though, that your grandson’s teacher and parents know the rules in their district. Do you really want to insert yourself in the sensitive issue of your grandson’s behavior problems? Rules are important. But no one asked for your advice here."
53,2021-03-11,"My mother died in June and was cremated, as provided in her will. For practical reasons, my brother took possession of her ashes. Now it’s March, and he hasn’t done a single thing about burying her ashes beside my father’s, as she requested. When I reminded him, he got defensive and changed the subject.My brother had a difficult relationship with my mother, as he does with me. Since her death, he has focused on dividing her assets and readying her home for sale. His behavior upsets me greatly. I find it unconscionable! Admittedly, burying ashes in another state presents logistical issues, but my mother left money for burial. The only concession I’ll make is that he works full time and I’m retired (though he managed to take a week of vacation). Your thoughts? ’m sorry for your loss. I’m also sorry for your brother’s loss. I think you are mistaken, though, if you suppose his grief is diminished because he had a difficult relationship with your mother. Complicated connections can often lead to more punishing sorrow.I am also struck by the unfair division of labor here. You say it was “practical” for your brother to take your mother’s ashes. Has it also been practical for him to manage her assets and the sale of her home single-handedly, while you stand by nursing grievances? If you aren’t satisfied with your brother’s pace, pitch in.If we’ve learned anything during the pandemic, it’s that many tasks can be accomplished remotely. Call the funeral home director, arrange for shipment (or pickup) of the ashes and schedule the burial. If you and your brother want to attend, work out a date. If he still avoids the subject, proceed on your own. (And skip the petty cracks about working people taking time off, ?).Christoph NiemannStimulus SpendingMy husband and I have a modest income and retirement savings, but not much cash. This spring, our only child will graduate from college. He lives at home and received generous financial aid, so he has only $6,000 in low-interest debt. (We paid his tuition.) The issue: How to spend our next stimulus check? My son and I want to use the money for ligament surgery for our middle-age pit bull. (The dog is in chronic pain.) My husband wants to use the money to pay off a car loan and give the rest to our son as a graduation gift. Help!ell, since you’ve omitted the price tags of the surgery and the car loan (and I’m not a veterinarian), let’s discuss process and values, instead. Convene a family meeting to discuss the allocation of the stimulus check. Many times, efforts to ensure that everyone feels heard and respected are more important than perfect agreement.Theoretically, your son will agree to forego a cash gift. He wants to help the dog. As between easing the pain of a family pet and paying off a car loan, that would be an easy call for me. (But I’m not part of your family!) If you decide to do both and the stimulus check is not sufficient, take care to preserve lower-interest loans over incurring high-interest, credit card debt.I Didn’t Think She’d Mind …My friend finally divorced her husband after years of complaining about him. After the divorce was final, my husband set up his single cousin with my friend’s ex. I figured since she was happy to be rid of him, she wouldn’t care. Wrong! She told me she was disappointed I didn’t ask her permission. I haven’t apologized because I don’t think I did anything wrong. Now my friend isn’t talking to me. Who’s right?ave you ever had an ex? For many of us, they trigger ambivalent feelings, even if we’re relieved to put them behind us. It may not be strictly logical for your friend to resent you and your husband for setting up the man with whom she was (mostly) unhappy, but it doesn’t surprise me either.What’s more startling here is your willingness to alienate a friend by refusing to apologize for accidentally hurting her feelings. That kind of inflexibility can be more damaging to relationships than the underlying harm. Why not say: “I didn’t know it would hurt you, but I’m sorry we did.”Remember That Gift You Got Us?My husband and I got married four years ago. We sent thank-you notes to half our guests, then ran out of steam. There was no rhyme or reason for those who got notes or didn’t, and we have no excuse. We feel guilty about this, and we know it was inconsiderate. Is it too weird to send the rest of the thank-you notes now, or should we let ourselves off the hook at this point?ou are really testing the limits of “better late than never”! But I would send the remaining notes. People are more likely to chuckle and appreciate them than to resent your delay. As for the text of the notes, you hit the high points in your letter: so sorry, no excuse, really grateful for your lovely gift. Now, get them done!"
54,2021-03-18,"My twin brother and I exchange gifts on our birthday. In recent years, he’s gotten lazy about it. His presents often seem like last-minute efforts. This year was our 30th birthday, so I expected a little more. But when he arrived at my house, he said he’d left my present in his friend’s car and would give it to me later. It sounded fishy, and he never gave me a gift. Then came my husband’s birthday last month. My brother sent a birthday text and said a card and gift would arrive in the mail soon. Sure enough, nothing came. I’m more upset about my brother’s lying than the absence of gifts. Should I say something about his dishonesty or let this go? have known many people like your brother. (I have even been him on occasion!) He says whatever he thinks will smooth over the awkwardness he’s feeling. By pretending to have a gift for you, when he knows he should but obviously doesn’t, he trades his trustworthiness for immediate comfort. Bad call!In the moment, he might intend to buy you a gift later. But he doesn’t. So, what begins as a well-intentioned fib becomes a lazy lie. He also draws special attention to his thoughtlessness: By teasing a nonexistent gift, he likely makes you feel even worse. The central problem isn’t lying, though — it’s grasping for easy outs.Tell him: “I get that you feel guilty about blowing off gifts. But when you promise to deliver one, then don’t, you underline the fact that you can’t be bothered. Do you want to stop exchanging gifts?” If you can do this gently, you may help your brother tackle an ugly habit (that is probably not limited to you) and stop hurting your feelings, as well..Christoph NiemannOffice SpaceI applied for a job and was thrilled when the hiring manager contacted me to set up a phone interview. After asking me briefly about my experience, she told me the job is on-site, Monday to Friday. I assumed it would be a remote setup because of the pandemic. She explained that the company has extremely strong safety protocols, but I told her I wouldn’t be comfortable working in an office until I’ve been vaccinated (and I think it will be a while before I’m eligible for that). She said she understood and ended the interview. I sent a thank-you note, but truthfully, I was annoyed that she’d wasted my time. Shouldn’t she have told me about the on-site setup in our email exchange? Was there a gracious way to express my frustration?E.Your annoyance seems overblown to me. I understand you’re disappointed, but the whole process sounds as if it took less than 30 minutes. Many companies’ attendance guidelines are in flux now. So, unless your correspondence with the hiring manager was voluminous, I think she behaved appropriately.More important, you missed two golden opportunities here: to ask her about the company’s protocols, which may have satisfied you, and whether she would consider letting you work from home until you’re vaccinated. Applying for a job is a conversation. Try to keep it going until you’ve explored the possibilities.Look What I Did!Last week, in a fit of pandemic boredom, I brought home a broken-down antique chair that our neighbors had thrown away. I spent a few days in my workshop fixing it up. Now it looks great, and I’d like to give it back to them. My wife thinks this would be weird. (We don’t know them.) I could leave it on their porch anonymously or find another home for it if our neighbors don’t want it. What do you think? love your idea, David — and not just because I’ve knitted two million pandemic hats that I’ve foisted on nearly everyone I know. Your gesture seems neighborly and kind. And what a nice way to meet people who live on your street!Put on a mask and bring the chair to their door. Introduce yourself and thank them for giving you a pandemic project. Then tell them you’d like to give them the refurbished chair, but if they don’t want it, you’ll be happy to take it away. Kindness is always welcome, especially in times like these.This You?I am a college student who returned to campus this semester. Since I’ve been back, my absolute hero has been the doctor who runs student health services. I’ve asked her a million questions about Covid-19, and she always makes time to answer them. The problem: Yesterday, I saw her walking into a shop without a mask. Now what?f you knew the song “If You Could Read My Mind” (either the Gordon Lightfoot original or the thrilling disco version of my youth), you would probably remember its best lyric: “Heroes often fail.” They’re only human!You’ve never stepped outside and realized you’d forgotten a mask? The campus doctor probably remembered hers eventually. Next time, remind her gently. She’ll thank you!"
55,2021-03-25,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have been shocked by the amount of racist political language aimed at Asian-Americans and the spike in hate crimes against the community. As a white person, I feel ashamed that I didn’t focus on this problem sooner. During this period, I have often thought about a Korean-American woman I worked with several years ago. We grew close and moved our friendship beyond the office (dinners with our partners and theater evenings, etc.). I’d like to check in with her now and express my support over recent events. But it’s been several years since we’ve been in touch, and something is holding me back. What do you think? don’t want to sound harsh here. Your heart is in the right place, and expressions of support can often bring comfort to those who are suffering. But if you haven’t been in touch with your friend in years, contacting her now may seem more like racial profiling to her — “Hey, I know an Asian-American!” — than personal support.Calling or writing out of the blue may also be burdensome to her now. Last summer, during the Black Lives Matter protests, I heard from several Black readers that the volume of well-meaning overtures they received from white people they hadn’t spoken to in ages felt overwhelming at a time when they were traumatized and exhausted.Now, this is not an argument against rekindling old friendships. Just do it when the impulse is centered on your friend (or your shared history), not current events. In the meantime, focus on actions you can take to help the Asian-American community, like educating yourself about the history and current circumstances of violence and racism, volunteering, supporting local businesses, or donating to anti-violence organizations. “Thoughts and prayers” are great, but there’s hard work to be done, too..Christoph NiemannDid You Miss the Sign?There is a woman in our neighborhood who still appears at the supermarket and post office without a mask. (Of course, both places have large “Masks Required” signs.) When confronted, she will say, “I can’t wear one,” but she won’t say why. There is a Tea Party flag flying at her house, so it seems more likely that her anti-masking is tied to politics than health. What may I say to her? I don’t want to start a fight.h, I suspect you have mixed feelings about starting a fight. And your argument for her motivation is flimsy. Still, I acknowledge that medical reasons for not wearing masks are rare; asserting a ‘freedom’ — to go maskless — at the expense of public health is indefensible; and infection with the more transmissible coronavirus variants is a powerful argument for staying masked in public.By now, though, this woman’s position on masks is probably hard-boiled. And as an acquaintance, you are unlikely to change her mind or behavior. Why not focus on protecting others in your community by advising them to double up on masks? That may be more effective than sparring with your unmasked neighbor.Not Pointing Fingers, but …For about a year, I have employed a housekeeper who is splendid in nearly every way. She does a great job cleaning, and she is warm and kind. Unfortunately, some not insignificant items have disappeared from our home over the past few months: some very old ivory figurines that have great sentimental value for my husband and, possibly, some fine jewelry. How should I handle this?he flashing red light in your question is the word “possibly” in the next-to-last sentence. If you can’t say with certainty the last time and place you saw these objects, go slow here! Is your housekeeper the only other person with access to your home? Were the figurines on display until they disappeared?Only you can assess your level of certainty. In my experience, though, my memory of where I’ve put things has failed me more often than anyone I’ve employed. Why not start by asking your housekeeper to help you look for the missing items? If they don’t turn up and you’re still uncomfortable, you’re free to fire her. But without greater confidence, don’t say a word about theft.Throw Away Your Dog Poop. Just Not Here.I pride myself on being a responsible dog owner. Not only do I pick up my dog’s poop, I also pick up litter along the street. I throw it into garbage cans both public and private. Recently, I saw a post on a neighborhood message board lamenting the fact that people are dumping dog poop in the poster’s garbage can while it is at the curb on garbage pickup day. He wrote: “Am I supposed to let it stink up my garage for a week? Don’t do this!” Am I wrong to use whatever bins I see?f course you’re wrong! A homeowner’s private garbage can is not for public use even when it’s on the curb on trash collection day. And the message board post is persuasive in its reasoning: Would you want dog poop moldering in your garage until the following week’s trash pickup? Use your city’s public receptacles instead."
56,2021-04-01,"My mom married a man 10 years ago and became a different person. She is still loving to us, but her politics changed drastically. Among other things, she is now adamantly opposed to vaccines. When my son was born a few years ago, it was a fight to have her get a flu shot before flying to visit us. Her husband refused and skipped our son’s bris. Now we’re arguing about the Covid vaccine. She wants to visit, but she and her husband refuse to take the vaccine. I told her until she does, she is not welcome to stay with us. She can’t believe I’m keeping her grandchildren from her. Where do I go from here? I want my kids to have more than a FaceTime relationship with her.or starters, stop blaming your stepfather for your mother’s decisions. She is an adult and responsible for her own choices. If she’s aware of your low opinion of her husband, that won’t help; she loves him. Plus, you can hardly pin the ascendancy of political tribalism and conspiracy theories on one man who married into your family.I would recast your ultimatum — you’re not welcome here unless you’re vaccinated — into a statement of concern: “I want the kids safe, and I want you safe. Until we or you are vaccinated, let’s follow the advice of the C.D.C. and keep up masking and social distancing.” This gives her an option. Maybe she stays at a hotel nearby and meets you at the park?Now, don’t misunderstand me: I get that it’s maddening to hear your mother spout misinformation about a lifesaving vaccine. You can pull together a package of data from a wide range of sources for her. You may make some inroads. Be gentle, but don’t relent. Your main job is to keep yourself and your family safe..Christoph NiemannCall Me By My Name!Like many women, I didn’t take my husband’s last name when we married. Still, four years into our marriage, his family refers to me by his name. This makes me angry! I’ve asked my husband to correct them. He always agrees but has yet to do it. Now, we’re expecting a baby, and we plan to give our child my last name. I’m worried that his family will soon refer to me and our child by my husband’s name. Will a birth announcement clear this up?our anger is misdirected. We all deserve to be called by the right name. But if no one ever corrected your in-laws about yours, how were they to know? (Some people would ask whether you were keeping your name; others may not.) By promising to handle this and never doing it, though, your husband let you down.Time to take matters into your own hands. This may be easier for you than for him. A birth announcement including the baby’s surname is a good start. But you will probably still have to correct your in-laws. Do it nicely in calls or notes about baby showers and gifts: “I should have told you ages ago that I decided to keep my name, and our baby will use it too.” (It’s also time for a talk with your husband about idle promises.)Poor Hygiene in a Pandemic YearMy girlfriend and I just moved in together. (I relocated to her town.) We’re very happy, but I have a problem: The walls in our apartment are thin. And I often hear her use the bathroom without washing her hands afterward. This grosses me out! Can I raise this issue without making her feel bad?f you can’t figure out how to discuss awkward issues with your girlfriend, your relationship is probably doomed. I like the direct approach (with a safety net of kindness). One day, when you’re both at home and feeling relaxed, say: “I’m so happy I moved here to be with you.” Let her feel loved.Then say: “There’s an issue that bothers me, though. After you use the bathroom, can you remember to wash your hands? It’s important to me.” (This year more than ever, perhaps.) She may feel embarrassed or defensive at first. But making sure she feels safe before saying something critical of her increases the odds that your talk will go well.So Much for Hospitality?My pet peeve has survived the pandemic! Some friends and relatives have been vaccinated against Covid-19, so I was able to host a small birthday dinner. I set the table with cloth napkins, but many guests didn’t use them. When the table was cleared, I found them untouched. Do they think I prefer them to wipe their hands on their socks? I think it’s rude not to use what I’ve offered. You?ho knows why guests do what they do? Maybe they want to save your cloth napkins from tomato sauce — or spare you the extra work of laundering and ironing them (though you probably do that anyway).I know something more important, though: Making people feel comfortable in our homes, by overlooking small gaffes, is a mark of great hosts and the best table manners around."
57,2021-04-08,"While waiting in a long line to get my Covid-19 vaccination, I noticed two boisterous white men ahead of me. At first I chalked up their noise to excitement. But as I waited, I realized they were harassing an older Black woman who was in line in front of them. They were crowding her and telling her to move up, even though she was keeping an appropriate social distance, and calling out to her nastily to “pick up her feet” and “stop shuffling.” The older woman ignored them. And I was afraid to intervene for fear the men would turn their anger on me. What should I have done?ow heartbreaking that an otherwise joyful experience — getting vaccinated after more than a year of Covid-related fear, suffering and death — was marred for this woman by harassment. I wish someone had protected her. But I respect your fear for your safety, too. Bullying can be terrifying not only for its victims but also for bystanders wary of escalation.Still, there are tactics for intervening and defusing situations like these: You might have left the line briefly to enlist the help of someone who worked at the site or who looked physically imposing. Distraction can also be effective. Asking the men if they were in line for their first or second shots, for instance, may have interrupted their abuse and set them on a different path.Naturally, our first impulse in such cases is often to stop the abuse (and often to punish the abusers). But it’s just as important to tend to the victims. I may have joined the woman in line, for instance, to support her. (That may have felt risky to you.) And I would have made sure to find her in the recovery area to ask if she wanted help or someone to walk out with her..Christoph NiemannGender Is a Construct, but He’s a BoyMy son is 9. He was born a boy and identifies as one. He participates in football and Boy Scouts, and he prefers clothes from the boys’ side of the store. He also likes his long wavy hair that falls beneath his shoulders. This is not a battle we feel like picking with him. Other boys at school have similar hairstyles. The issue: It’s pretty common for strangers to refer to my son as “your daughter.” What’s the best way to handle this? The last time I corrected someone gently, she looked at me like I was crazy. How can we support our son’s choice while not allowing others to misgender him? he striking omission from your question is how your son feels about strangers referring to him as a girl. If it doesn’t upset him, keep correcting people gently and stop worrying about their apparent mystification. Who cares what strangers think? I’m more concerned about your feelings. The “battle” you mention not picking with your son, for instance, implies that you may be on Team Haircut.Here’s the thing: The traditional division of hairstyles, clothing and activities into “male” and “female” types is artificial (even if we policed them pretty strictly for ages). Times are changing, though, and many people are beginning to loosen up about gender markers. Why shouldn’t a boy have long hair or a girl play football?Now, the caveat here is if your son is upset by the misgendering. If he is, explain to him that in the past, boys wore their hair short. So, a person with long hair might appear to be a girl. Ask if the occasional mislabeling bothers him enough to cut his hair. (If he likes it, I hope he feels secure enough to keep it. But I don’t get a vote.)Kindly R.S.V.P. (If You’re Vaccinated!)My daughter is getting married on the West Coast. We want to give a party for her on the East Coast in July. We’re about to send out invitations. Is there a polite way to say that only people who’ve been vaccinated can come?hy let a random date or your impatience (which I totally understand) jeopardize the health of your guests? Hold up on party planning! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people continue to avoid large gatherings at this time.I and (presumably) you are not qualified to second-guess these guidelines or to predict when they may change. When the C.D.C. announces recommendations for the type of party you want to give (inevitably including questions of vaccination), set the date and send your invitations then. Armed with the facts, we can deal with invitation wording then too.You Know That’s Not a Dog, Right?My neighbor, who has always seemed out-there to me, has started walking her cat on a leash around the neighborhood. This looks super-freaky! Can I ask her what gives?M.M.Sure, but I wouldn’t lead with “super-freaky.” Say, “How novel to see your handsome cat on a leash! Was it hard to train her?” Most of us have been in varying states of isolation for over a year now. These walks — which hurt no one, including the cat — may be the highlight of your neighbor’s day. Who are we to judge her?"
58,2021-04-15,"Last year, my brother and his wife suffered a tragic loss when their young son drowned in an accident at their home. Since then, my sister-in-law has been extremely reluctant to travel to see our family, and I’m not sure why. My brother would love to visit, but I think he defers to her because she comes from a wealthy family that has bought them several properties and pays for their older son’s tuition at an expensive private school. I also think my sister-in-law feels guilty. They were at home when their son died, but left the boys to swim unsupervised. We don’t blame her for what happened. I just want my daughter to see her cousins more often. How can I build a bridge?’m sure you mean well, but you seem to need emergency lessons in empathy. Your sister-in-law is grieving! A year is like the blink of an eye after the devastating loss of a child. She may feel unable to plan and undertake leisure travel for your convenience.There’s also the pandemic. Keeping her family safe and healthy probably strikes an even deeper chord for her under current circumstances. Attributing your brother’s deference to his in-laws’ wealth — and even mentioning blame for the child’s death — is insensitive. It was an accident! Isn’t it likelier that he and his wife are being gentle with each other because of their shared grief?Try to put yourself in their position. The only question here should be: What can I do to ease their suffering? Start by offering a loving (and judgment-free) ear whenever they want to talk. You can also offer to visit them if they’re up for visitors and if you can agree on safety protocols that make sense. Take their lead, though. They’re going through something very difficult..Christoph NiemannWe Got the Jab. Sorry?My family has been friends with a wonderful older couple for years. My spouse and I and our young adult children have all been fully vaccinated. We explored all legitimate avenues for early vaccination, and we found them (e.g. underlying health conditions, in-person volunteering and working as a teaching assistant). The older couple has been very principled about waiting their turn. They’re not fully vaccinated yet. And I was not honest with them about our family’s status; I felt guilty. But during a recent (socially distant) visit, my son blurted out the truth. Since then, we haven’t heard from them. What should I do? I would hate to lose their friendship.B.You didn’t do anything wrong in taking the vaccine as soon as state rules permitted it. (And nothing in your question suggests that you were dishonest about early qualification.) The only mistake you made was lying to your friends. I can even sympathize with that in the face of their patient stoicism.So, apologize! “I felt guilty that we were vaccinated and you weren’t. We didn’t break any rules, but I was afraid you’d think less of us for going early. I’m sorry I was dishonest with you. Will you forgive me?” I bet they will.About Those Photographs …Six years ago, I sold my home to move to a smaller one in another state. My neighbor had long admired a trio of large, gallery-framed photographs I own. Since my new house couldn’t accommodate them, she volunteered to “take care of them” until I wanted them again. Well, now I’ve bought a larger house, and I would love to have the photographs back. They are very personal and meaningful to me. How cheesy would it be to ask for them?’m less concerned with how meaningful the photographs are to you than with how clear you were with your former neighbor that you might want them back some day. If the possibility of reclaiming the art was merely a thought bubble that floated silently above your head, consider the photographs hers. You made a gift.If you were clear about the pictures being on loan, though, it’s not cheesy to ask for them back. (You should pay to have them packed and shipped to you.) Don’t be surprised if your friend is a little annoyed. Six years is a long time, and this is probably not how she envisioned the story ending — though in fairness, it was always a possibility.LinkedIn Me vs. the Real MeA friend told me that my LinkedIn profile is cold and boring because I don’t mention anything about hobbies or outside interests. But I prefer to keep my personal life to myself. Is that wrong? Do I owe potential employers an accounting of my time during unemployment? Should I tell them I’ve been painting pictures of trees and writing racy short stories?V.You owe potential employers nothing. It’s your call whether to include personal interests on your LinkedIn profile. But (and this may annoy you) as soon as you mentioned your tree paintings and racy stories, I grew more interested in you. It’s human nature, I think, to be drawn to the person behind a résumé. Now, less is more here. So, if you can bear it, a dab of human interest may enhance your job prospects."
59,2021-04-22,"My husband and I disagree about whether toy guns are appropriate for our kids and under what circumstances they may be used. Last weekend, our two young sons were given water guns as gifts, which they quickly put to use outdoors. They played with the toy guns as if they were real — shouting “Bang!” when they fired them and collapsing onto the ground when they were hit. I’m afraid that even toy guns send a message of insensitivity to our neighbors during this time of persistent mass shootings. My husband disagrees, and the boys continue to use the guns outdoors. Am I overreacting? respect your desire to be a good neighbor. But in your quest, you seem to have skipped over the bigger question here: Should your sons be playing with toy guns at all? You may not have bought them — and your husband may find them harmless — but that doesn’t settle the matter.Personally, I don’t think anyone should become desensitized to the act of pointing a gun at another person (even if the gun is made of chocolate). Life and limb are precious! I also acknowledge, though, that as a young boy my brother turned practically any item he picked up — pencils, carrots, action figures — into a make-believe gun, and nothing my parents said stopped him. Play is complicated.Take another crack at explaining your concerns about gunplay to your husband. Wouldn’t the boys have just as much fun with water balloons? If you can’t agree, you and your husband should have a serious talk with your sons about guns. Set some firm ground rules for using the water guns, starting with: You may never leave the yard with them, and you may never point them at anyone without their permission.As for sensitivity to your neighbors, again, look homeward. If you think the boys are old enough, start with a family discussion where you invite them to share what they know (and how they feel) about mass shootings. Then take it from there. An age-appropriate conversation about gun violence and the steps we can take — even in play — to make everyone safer may improve the situation on your lawn..Christoph NiemannNot Even a ‘Get Well Soon’?I live in a gated community. Some of us women started a monthly get-together to share recommendations and details about upcoming events. A month ago, I suffered a heart attack one Saturday morning. I’m sure my neighbors saw the ambulance and fire truck in our driveway! On my return from the hospital, only two of the 40 members of the group contacted me. (Some of them now ignore me when they walk past my home.) I have gone out of my way for many of these women. I know enough not to blame myself, but I don’t know what to do with my disappointment. Am I being a Karen?’m sorry your neighbors haven’t lived up to your expectations. Don’t underestimate the distancing effects of the pandemic and, more likely, your neighbors’ desire to respect your privacy about a health crisis. You don’t mention telling anyone about your heart attack.If you want to talk about it, bring it up. As for neighbors who “ignore” you now, I suspect that some are unsure about broaching the subject of your illness. I’m not blaming you for your feelings. But neighbors walk a fine line between support and discretion. By raising the subject yourself, you can help them land on the side you prefer.Where Dogs RuleA few years ago, I was attacked by a dog. It permanently disfigured my leg. I’ve since moved to a city where attitudes toward dogs are comparatively lax. Owners let their dogs off-leash in areas where it’s illegal. I’ve been growled at by aggressive dogs. And last week, a large dog jumped on me — while it was on a leash. The owners playfully scold their dogs or assure me they’re friendly. Meanwhile, I’m forced to relive the trauma of my attack. I bite my tongue and move on rather than yell at strangers. But I’m tired of avoiding parks and yielding to unruly dogs. Your thoughts?og owners are always responsible for controlling their dogs in public. Unfortunately, though, authorities are seldom around when owners fail to behave properly. So, I suggest a middle ground between biting your tongue (useless!) and yelling at people (which can needlessly escalate problems).Say directly, but not angrily: “Please get your dog under control. I don’t want contact with it.” Careless owners may think you’re a meanie, but responsible ones will know you’re right and appreciate the warning.The Missing InviteI’ve been going out with a guy for almost three months. Things seem to be going really well. So, I was surprised that he didn’t invite me to Easter dinner with his family. I’ve been edgy about this, but I haven’t said anything to him. Should I?t’s always nice to be included. But “almost three months” is very brief in the grand scheme of things. If I were you, I’d let Easter slide. Focus on deepening your relationship, and see what happens on the Fourth of July."
60,2021-04-29,"My firm asked all employees to add our pronouns to our email signatures to promote inclusivity. So, I did: “He/him/his.” I am in sales and send out hundreds of outreach emails every week. Today, a potential customer replied: “Not interested.” He said he was “turned off by the unnecessary pronoun thing.” I support inclusivity. But this interaction made me wonder about the risks and rewards of my company’s policy. My email signature isn’t suddenly going to make anyone more welcoming to nonbinary people. But some may be turned off by it. And I don’t think leaving off my pronouns would offend anyone. Am I wrong?ou and I have different concerns about your firm’s policy. For cisgender people — whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth — there is practically no cost to including pronouns. (I’ll come back to your sales pitches.) For trans or nonbinary people who aren’t ready to come out, though, this policy is problematic: It pressures people to either out themselves before they’re comfortable or lie.Now, your firm’s intentions are clearly good. Including pronouns may not suddenly change people’s minds, as you say, but it’s a useful reminder to avoid making assumptions and to address people correctly. It may also make it easier for some trans and nonbinary people to come out. A better guideline would ask you to consider including your pronouns. (For many, an employer’s direct request means: “Do it — or else!”)As for lost sales, I assume your firm weighed the value of inclusivity against possible backlash before they instituted the policy. Report this episode to your manager if you like. And if you’re comfortable doing so, please share my concern about pressuring employees to share sensitive information. I applaud the spirit of your firm’s policy, but I think it could use some fine-tuning..Christoph NiemannNo Protocols? No Party.My sister is refusing the Covid vaccine. Her adult children are having a birthday celebration for their children, but my nieces (the hosts) are refusing to tell invitees whether they are vaccinated or will be by party time. They say they don’t want to upset their mother. The party will be held indoors, and the number of guests will exceed the current limit on indoor gatherings in our state. I know some guests will not wear masks. My husband wants to go; he feels as if he’s already missed out on too much family time. If we don’t go, it will be a blow to relations with my sister and her family, which have always been great until the pandemic. Is this a lost cause?K.S.Disagreements don’t have to be lost causes. And avoiding them is no reason to humor people (who are making bad choices) or put ourselves at risk. I sympathize with your nieces’ predicament with their mother, but wise people are making decisions about parties based on data points now: vaccination status, the size of indoor gatherings and mask use. It’s disingenuous to pretend these facts don’t matter!Call your nieces and your sister. Say: “You know I love you, but we’re handling the pandemic differently. I won’t be able to see you indoors until the C.D.C. tells us it’s safe to gather in large groups with unvaccinated and unmasked people. I’m sorry that I’ll miss your party.”This is an even-tempered approach to a problem that’s beyond your power to fix. And I trust that your husband’s totally understandable desire to mingle again will be outweighed by the real-world prospects of becoming ill or infecting others with the virus.Calling All ItaliansMy husband and I are expecting our first baby this summer. My in-laws, who have no Italian heritage, have selected Italian names for our baby to call them: Nonno and Nonna. My husband and I are very uncomfortable with this. We think it’s cultural appropriation. What should we do?R.At a glance, this seems more like cultural appreciation than appropriation to me. If there is any disrespect of Italian culture or failure to acknowledge the source of the names here, it isn’t immediately apparent.Perhaps the best litmus test for questions like these is: Would an Italian object? I doubt it. Appropriation is thorny, though. Why not ask your in-laws how they landed on the names before you decide what to do?About That Freebie …I had an allergic reaction to an expensive face mask, so the manufacturer sent me several to make up for it. I mentioned this to my friend. She asked for one. Thinking I had a half-dozen, I said yes. But it turns out, I only have three, and I don’t want to give one to her. I spoke in haste. (This is a person who often fails to follow through on promises like “I’ll take you to lunch for your birthday.”) What should I do?S.A promise made is a debt unpaid. Give her a mask. This will remind you not to speak in haste the next time. It’s also a bad idea to rationalize poor behavior by pointing to the failures of others. But feel free to remind your grabby friend that you’re ready for that birthday lunch now!"
61,2021-05-06,"When the pandemic lockdown began last year, I brought my elderly parents from New York City to live with my husband, our adult kids (who also came home) and me in our home in the suburbs. My parents stayed until July. Since then, they have visited for long weekends and other stays (driven back and forth by me). My problem: I don’t want to live with my parents, but they’ve begun hinting that they’d like to live with us or spend the summer with us, though they never explicitly say so. My parents are very old, but they’re still able to care for themselves. (I do their big shopping for them.) I love them, but I don’t want them here full time. How do I handle this? get the two-step of your parents’ shy hints and your reluctance to hurt their feelings. Still, I think the kindest thing here is to have a direct conversation with them. Living with you or staying put are not their only options. Why not help them explore some other possibilities?Start with a simple statement: “You know how much I love you, but I don’t think it would be good for me or my marriage for you to move in with us. I was thinking, though, you may like to consider some alternatives to living in the city.”Depending on their finances and, perhaps equally important, the vibrancy of their social network at home, they may welcome a move to an apartment or an assisted-living facility closer to you. They can even try it for a few months before they make any final decisions.You would likely see them more often this way, but they wouldn’t be under your roof. And helping them find clubs or affinity groups of interest may ease their move to a new place, so they aren’t totally reliant on you. Best of all, you address their hinting productively by helping them to make a decision based on their true options..Christoph NiemannBut Our Employment Pact!I’m in high school and looking for a summer job. I planned with my sister and cousin that we’d all work together at the same place. My cousin wants to work at a coffee shop. But when I applied, they never got back to me. I don’t know if they got back to her either. I was recently offered a job at a produce market, which I think I’d like better than working at a coffee shop. I still want to work with my cousin though. Would it be  to take the job at the produce market even though we all agreed to work together?M.K.It may have been a tad optimistic to think that one small business was going to hire three blood relatives for the summer. Out of respect for your joint plan, though, why not circle back to your sister and cousin with an update?Say: “I never heard back from the coffee shop. But I did get an offer from the produce market, which I’d like to take. Can I put in a good word for you there, or are you still holding out for the coffee shop?”Apartment Sitting … Plus One?My husband and I relocated to another city for work. His brother agreed to look after our apartment until we decided whether to sell it or rent it. After we left, my brother-in-law asked my husband if he could bring his girlfriend from another city to stay in our apartment for an unspecified period. This made me uncomfortable: He still lives with his wife, though he claims they sleep in separate bedrooms and plan to divorce. But I like his wife, and I’ve never met his girlfriend. I said no. Now, my brother-in-law is furious with me. Should I relent? t’s not unreasonable (or prudish!) to refuse your brother-in-law’s request to let a stranger use your apartment — as a love nest or otherwise. It’s your home; you and your husband get to decide who stays in it.This question becomes even easier (for me) given the amorphous state of your brother-in-law’s marriage and the likelihood of awkward gatherings with your sister-in-law in the future. Let him find a place on Airbnb for his girlfriend! Of course, unless you have security cameras, you’ll probably never know if they use the apartment anyway.Snip No MoreDuring the pandemic, I’ve been giving haircuts to people in my pod. I’m not a hairdresser by any means; I’m just good at following YouTube instructions. One friend has been so happy with my haircuts that she said she won’t have to go to her stylist anymore. Now that my friends and I are fully vaccinated, how do I tell them nicely that my services are no longer available?he next time a friend asks for a haircut, just say: “I’ve hung up my shears for now. It was a lot of pressure not to mess up.” Or, tell them you’ve joined the ranks of celebrity stylists who charge many hundreds of dollars (some as much as a thousand) for a chop. Either approach should take you off the hook."
62,2021-05-13,"My wife and I have a disaster on our hands! We recently moved across the country with our 8-year-old daughter for a major job opportunity for my wife. We don’t know a soul in our suburban town. And I believe this is a critical time for our daughter to learn social skills and make friends (especially after a year of isolation). The problem: The only other kids in our neighborhood don’t mask or social distance when they ask her to play. When I talked to their parents about Covid precautions, they looked at me like I had three heads and refused. Nothing is more important than our daughter’s safety, but we care about her socialization too. What should we do?tart by dialing back the drama. There is no “disaster” here. Sure, it would be super convenient if your daughter could play safely with her neighbors. But apparently she can’t. (You asked!) Wearing masks and social distancing are still important for playmates who are too young to be vaccinated.Now, if you can trust your daughter to stay outdoors while she’s playing in the neighborhood, there’s strong evidence that her risk of infection is very low. If you’re still uncomfortable, though, venture beyond your neighborhood to find parks, playgroups or after-school activities that prioritize safety. Your daughter’s teacher or the parents of children in her class may be helpful in pointing you in the right direction.Clinical trials of Covid vaccines are already underway on children as young as 6 months old. Once the results are in, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will undoubtedly make recommendations for younger kids. I know this has been a tough year for your family. But try to hang on! Things aren’t perfect, but help is on the way..Christoph NiemannShe’s Still My Daughter-in-Law …One of our sons married his high school sweetheart after graduation. During college, he was diagnosed with cancer and died four years into their marriage. Our daughter-in-law remains very close to us. Eventually, she married again, and now she has a new baby. When I speak of her to people I don’t know well, I usually refer to her as “my daughter-in-law.” But inevitably this leads to a conversation about what happened to our son. I’d like to avoid that. But I don’t like referring to her as “my former daughter-in-law” because that sounds like they divorced. Any suggestions?’m sorry for your loss. I understand not wanting to rehash the story of your son’s death to near strangers. But if referring to his widow as your “daughter-in-law” leads to uncomfortable conversations, wouldn’t the same ones crop up if you called her your “former daughter-in-law”? (I assume people want to know which of your sons she married.)Why not exercise some poetic license here? I think you’re entitled to it. Call her a “dear family friend.” It’s the truth. And you avoid the painful subject of your son’s death as well as any implication that he was divorced from his wife.What About My Privacy Rights?Now that Covid restrictions are finally being lifted in my community, I find myself being subjected to an onslaught of rude questions. People claim they want to invite me to dinner or other events in their homes — but only if I’ve been vaccinated. So, they make conditional invitations, then ask about my vaccination status. I think this is a clear violation of my medical privacy. Am I wrong to be offended?n a word: Yes! Personal privacy rights are not absolute; they are always weighed against other values, like public health. It may be more productive, though, to focus on what’s reasonable here. As we begin to emerge from the ongoing pandemic, try to understand your friends’ attempts to safeguard you and themselves.It’s your prerogative, of course, not to answer questions about your vaccination status. But in that case, sensible hosts will probably assume you’re not vaccinated and will suggest outdoor activities, as recommended by the C.D.C., instead of inviting you into their homes. They’re not issuing conditional invitations to be nosy or cruel. They’re just trying to check the spread of a transmissible virus.Birthday BluesFor years, I’ve paid my friend’s entrance fee to a golf tournament that takes place on his birthday. Every year he asks: “How much do I owe you?” And I respond: “It’s your birthday gift. Happy birthday!” Yet several months later, my birthday goes unnoticed. I don’t expect a gift, but I feel slighted that I don’t even receive an acknowledgment. He knows when my birthday is. Should I stop my gifts or speak up? wouldn’t be so sure that your friend knows your birth date. Even one of my brothers’ birthdays is hard for me to remember. (It’s confusingly close to my father’s.) Some people have better recall (or try harder) than others.Now, I also suspect that stopping your gift will bother you more than your friend. It would require suppressing a generous impulse. If the only choice here is reciprocal birthday wishes or nothing, go with nothing. (Reminding other adults about your birthday is sad.) But does a nice tradition really have to end just because your pal doesn’t have a knack for dates?"
63,2021-05-20,"The large company I work for has offices throughout the United States. After Covid vaccines became available, a companywide email went out encouraging employees to send in pictures of our vaccination cards that would entitle us to a free gift card from an online retailer. I think this policy tricks employees into “telling on themselves” if they don’t get the vaccine and allows the company to track us. I am creeped out by this invasion of privacy! At the same time, I just moved into a new apartment and have never needed extra funds more than now. I am vaccinated, and the gift cards already exist. How hypocritical would I be to participate in a program that I thoroughly disapprove of? think you misunderstand capitalism. Your large employer wants to make you (and its customers!) feel safe enough to return to the office and keep coming in for one reason: That’s how it makes money! The lifesaving vaccine is just a means to a (more profitable) end.As for the gift card program, I see no problem with it. It creates a voluntary incentive for workers to contribute to the safety of the labor pool. You aren’t required to participate. And your employer still has to figure out how to keep unvaccinated workers and visitors safe while on company premises.Now, I expect we will soon see legal challenges to mandatory vaccination requirements by employers; the right to refuse the vaccines is built into their emergency use authorizations. But that’s a question for another day. Also, you’re broke! If I were you, I’d swap a picture of my vaccine record for a gift card any day. It’s a win-win situation..Christoph NiemannHow to Spend Those College Savings …My husband and I set up 529 college savings accounts for our two nieces and nephew to cover a year of tuition and expenses at a state school. But their parents are well off; they’ll pay for college. We learned recently, though, that our nephew’s girlfriend of two years will be responsible for almost all of her college expenses. We’ve never met her, but we’re considering offering her financial help. We recognize the potential pitfalls: complicating her relationship with our nephew and our relationships with other family members. What would you do?B.W.I love your generosity of spirit! The ever-rising costs of college are a huge barrier to the advancement of many talented young people. Still, I would approach this differently. Rather than complicating a stranger’s high-school romance (not to mention your family relationships) with money, consider heading to the local high school instead.Talk to an administrator about creating one or more grants for needy students who want to pursue higher education. You can even help choose the beneficiaries. (Perhaps your nephew’s girlfriend will be one of them.) However you decide to proceed, though, you’ll be making a big difference.You Must Be This Old to AttendMy partner and I are getting married next year. We don’t want children under 16 at our wedding. (Kids running around don’t seem fun to us.) This won’t be a problem for most of the invited families. But a few are a coming from long distances. In one case, it would mean excluding just one of several children. There’s also a single parent of a 10-year-old. How do we tell these people nicely that we really want them to come but leave their kids at home?read gently here. You have every right to create your own guest list. But parents tend to be attached to their children. (Go figure!) In the old days, addressing invitations just to those invited would have done the trick. Not today, though. Some families assume that their kids are also welcome, especially if they have to travel for the big event.Personally, I dislike “adults only” language on invitations, no matter how kindly phrased. It can be jarring. Make a few phone calls instead. Tell the parents that you and your partner want an adult wedding and reception. Then add: “If it’s hard for you to travel without the kids, we’ve arranged for some fun activities and hired a few sitters to watch them.” State your reasonable preference, but offer a practical solution, too.Post-Breakup Jewelry EtiquetteMy ex and I broke up last year. It was a mutual decision, and there are no hard feelings. Now, I’ve begun to date again. During our relationship, my ex gave me a beautiful silver necklace. I put it away for a few months while my feelings were tender, but now I’ve brought it out again. How weird is it to wear this necklace around future boyfriends? If they ask where I got it, can I be honest?B.P.Think of it this way: The relationship didn’t work out, but the necklace did! You’re wearing it again because it’s beautiful, not because you’re pining for your ex. So, why purge it from your wardrobe? In the (unlikely) event that someone asks where it came from, name-check the jewelry store and move on."
64,2021-05-27,"We have three adult children. Our middle son planned to be married last November, but the wedding was postponed for a year because of the pandemic. Recently we met him, his fiancée and his future in-laws in Florida, where the couple surprised us with a tiny beach wedding — just parents and one best friend. Trying to be inclusive, I sent a picture of the ceremony to my other two children. Rather than feeling joy for their brother, though, they were angry at being excluded and unaware of the wedding. (They both live thousands of miles away, and the large wedding postponed until this November is still on!) Further discussion has only led to more anger. The newlyweds are hurt that my other children won’t congratulate them, and I feel guilty for instigating the problem with the picture. How can I mediate peace?y the power vested in me (by no one, actually) you are hereby absolved! You did nothing wrong in sending a picture of the surprise wedding to your adult children. (The marriage was not likely to stay secret for long.) Still, this may be an opportune moment for you to step aside as mediator and let your children settle their conflict as (purported) adults. Instead of further advocacy, send them this column.I sympathize with all parties. On one side, there was a joyful wedding after a miserable year and a delicious surprise concocted by a bride and groom. On the other, there are the understandably hurt feelings of the groom’s siblings at being excluded from a big family event (or at least not being told about it in advance).I hope the couple was empathetic enough to apologize for the hurt they caused inadvertently. I get their behavior, though: After a stressful, open-ended delay, they saw a golden opportunity and grabbed it! Sadly, they neglected to inform the siblings. If they haven’t apologized yet, they should. And if your other children haven’t accepted the apology, their self-centeredness is on them..Miguel PorlanThe Strain of SlacktivismI grew up in a Muslim Arab-American family that always supported the Palestinian cause. My best friend of 10 years is Jewish with family ties to Israel. We have always held opposing views about the conflict in the Middle East, but we’ve been able to discuss them respectfully. This time around, though, the conflict is putting a big strain on our relationship. Our social media activism has created distance and awkwardness between us. I love my friend and don’t want to hurt our relationship. But this is a subject on which we don’t see eye-to-eye. How should we handle it? have a suggestion, though you may not like it. By your own account, the issue that’s creating distance between you and thwarting respectful communication, unlike before, is your “social media activism” — which I interpret as posting one-sided screeds that appeal only to people who already agree with you and make more nuanced discussion nearly impossible.I suggest you stop it. Now, don’t get me wrong: I like the catharsis of an angry post as much as the next person. But activism that shuts down conversation, as yours (and your friend’s) seems to have done, is not worth much. I’d beat a hasty retreat back to respectful mode, and I’d encourage your bestie to do the same.Dude, Where’s My Bandmate?I play in a band. All of the bandmates are on a group text chat. One of our members — a guy who has been in the band for more than 10 years — has stopped responding to texts about practices, gigs, etc. When pressed about his behavior, he retreats even further. How do we handle this ghosting situation? We don’t want to just give him the boot.ometimes, when people have personal difficulties, broadcasting them over group chat is uncomfortable. If you haven’t yet, call your bandmate directly and ask how he’s doing. It’s been a rough year. He may have a private explanation for his unresponsiveness, or he may simply have cooled on the band after a decade. It will be easier to figure out which it is one-on-one.I’ll Venmo You Later …My boyfriend’s brother is really bad at collecting debts. When we go out to dinner, for instance, he will pay with a credit card and tell us that he’ll send Venmo requests once he figures out what we owe. Because of this, I don’t thank him. Then weeks go by without a Venmo request. My boyfriend likes that his older brother is forgetful and refuses to remind him. But I don’t like owing people. Please help! ow exactly is this mooching accidental? After a few days, it seems quite intentional to me. Unless the brother’s Venmo story is merely a charade to pick up dinner tabs without argument, you’re both taking advantage of his absent-mindedness.I suggest texting him: “What do we owe you for dinner?” Just like that, he will probably tell you, and you can pay up! And next time, work out what you owe at the table. It’s really not that hard."
65,2021-06-03,"Now that we use credit cards to pay for coffees and ice cream cones, I’ve gotten used to seeing payment screens that show tip options. I consider these tips income transfers (from me to workers) rather than gratuities for services rendered. (Does scooping ice cream really require a tip?) Still, I was shocked recently when I used a credit card to pay for a carpet cleaning service and was shown tip options from five to 20 percent. It was uncomfortable to press “no tip” in front of the workers. But the service cost $700, so even a 10 percent tip would have raised the price significantly. I think these payment systems bully consumers. What do you think?ou’re asking, at heart, how to feel good about yourself while participating in an economy that denies many workers a living wage. Of course, you don’t set the pay for ice-cream scoopers or carpet cleaners. And it’s common among those who prefer not to think about our complicity to conclude that companies should pay their workers instead of relying on us to tip them. I see that point!Spoiler, though: Most companies don’t seem to be in a big rush to pay their workers any better. So, what should we do? I suggest some research on wages, generosity (in keeping with our means) and carrying cash. Remember: You don’t have to tip as a percentage of sales. You can also knock yourself out with letters to C.E.O.s!For ice-cream scoopers who likely earn minimum wage, for instance, I generally tip a dollar or two. I’d prefer that minimum wage was sufficient to live on. I also recognize that if workers were paid more, my ice cream cone would probably cost more too. I’m  with that. I bet most people would be.Now, consider service workers like carpet-cleaning technicians, who earn an average of $15 an hour. It would be hard to live on a salary of $30,000 in my area. So, under most circumstances, I would give them each $20 at the end of the day. You don’t have to! But let’s be real: The problem with income inequality — and particularly in the service industry — is not the payment screen..Miguel PorlanA Gift Return TrapWhen our twins were born, we were given generous baby gifts by many people, including my mother-in-law. Now that the twins are getting older, they are outgrowing the strollers, baby clothes and car seats. So, my husband has been selling gifts that were given to us by his side of the family to buy new things that we need now. The problem: My mother-in-law recently asked us to return the bigger-ticket items she gave us so her daughter can use them for her baby. (Note: My sister-in-law isn’t pregnant or in a serious relationship.) I was taken aback by her request. Gifts are gifts, right?-- am going to break one of my cardinal rules by assuming a few facts not in evidence. (It’s the only way I can make sense of this story.) Your mother-in-law has likely discovered that you are selling her gifts. Why else would she ask for them now?And you are being a little disingenuous by ignoring the sentimental value of baby gifts from a loving grandmother. As a general matter, you’re right: Once given, gifts are yours to do with as you please. But if baby gifts have no emotional value, why aren’t you selling any from your side of the family?Now, you lay the responsibility for these sales at your husband’s feet. But I suspect you agreed with his plan. So, speak to his mother together. Tell her (again?) how much you appreciate her gifts. Acknowledge that you’ve been selling them as the twins outgrow them. And assure her that the twins are told, with each new purchase, that their grandmother bought it for them. Maybe this will smooth some ruffled feathers.Pool Party PlanningMy wife and I, both fully-vaccinated, are hosting our son’s third birthday party at my in-laws’ house. The party will be held outdoors at their pool. The other guests will be a few family members who are also vaccinated. My wife’s sister initially said that she and her family would not attend because one of her sons is immunocompromised, and they are being extra cautious. Now, the sister is asking that my wife and I show her negative Covid test results before the party so she can feel more comfortable attending with her children. Her reasoning is that our son has contact with a teenage babysitter (also vaccinated) for two hours a week. The babysitter attends school in-person, so my sister-in-law thinks our son may have a risk of infection. Am I wrong to think this is an unreasonable request? It’s our party!ery few of us are epidemiologists — though many of us have played one for the last 15 months. You and I can’t properly evaluate your nephew’s health risks. But we can be extra empathetic to a mother who has probably been under extreme stress with an at-risk child.Say, “We’d love for your family to come to the party! But we’re not qualified to assess the risks to your son. If your pediatrician recommends testing in a situation where everyone is vaccinated, we’ll be happy to.” Think of it as a small mercy."
66,2021-06-10,"For 15 years, my parents have paid for my adult brother to live in an upscale apartment in the expensive city where he went to college. He doesn’t work. He barely graduated from college, lost touch with his friends, then flunked out of graduate school. My parents were mortified, and I encouraged him to find work. But he never did. Now my parents are resigned to supporting him indefinitely. With the pandemic ebbing, I keep trying to convince them that they should push my brother to apply for jobs and engage with the world. But when my brother refuses, my parents are cowed by him. So, they continue to support him, giving him nice hand-me-down cars and taking him to fancy dinners. This is madness! What more can I do?f you’d expressed concern for your brother’s emotional well-being or the roots of his seeming paralysis as an adult, it would be easier to sympathize with you. (He may be depressed, not a grifter.) But your question reads like a jealous tale of middle-age sibling rivalry: Mommy and Daddy give him too much!And even if you’re right — your brother is a mooch, and your parents enable his laziness — it doesn’t matter. Your family doesn’t take orders from you! You’ve expressed your opinion repeatedly, it seems, but your parents and brother are free to act as they choose. (To me, his issues seem more complex than the cost of an “upscale apartment” or the “fancy dinners” you focus on. I hope he seeks professional help.)I also get that your frustration may be drowning out your loving concern. Still, it’s hard to see how your continued involvement helps matters here. No one is asking for your assistance. Disentangle yourself and get on with your own life. Your energy will be better spent exploring how this family dynamic affects you..Miguel PorlanWhere’s My Kid’s Invite?My 10-year-old daughter has two best friends. The three of them play together occasionally, but the other two aren’t really friends and only see each other through my daughter. One of the mothers of these girls told me she would like her daughter to have a best friend like the other girl. Now, that mother has organized a play date with the other girl and didn’t invite my daughter. My daughter is hurt, and I’m annoyed. Are we wrong? Is there an etiquette for this?o my knowledge, there is no social equivalent of a “finder’s fee” that entitles your daughter to mandatory invitations every time children she’s introduced gather to play. Chill, Mom! It’s one play date.One of the most common ways to make new friends is through our pals’ existing friendships. And that’s good! It creates community. I encourage you to stop policing your child’s social calendar and help her focus on making a variety of friends. No one gets invited to everything.Dog Days of SummerLike many Americans, my next-door neighbor adopted a cute puppy during the pandemic. While we were in lockdown, she and the dog were together all day. Now that she’s gone back to work, and the puppy is on its own for hours at a stretch, it cries and barks and whines — a lot. It’s miserable to be next door! How should I handle this with my neighbor?nless the puppy has a delayed reaction to being left alone (and doesn’t start crying until your neighbor is out of earshot), she is probably aware of this problem to some extent. Let her know gently that her dog’s distress continues for the length of her absence.Say, “I’m sorry to tell you that your puppy barks and whines the whole time you’re away. It’s painful to hear! Have you started working on this yet?” Unfortunately for you and the puppy, improving its separation anxiety will be a process — one your neighbor will have to manage on her own or with the help of a good trainer (now that our dogs are accustomed to 24/7 companionship).Typo Alert!My brother-in-law sent us two free copies of his memoir. Our family tree is included in it. My husband (the author’s brother), one of our grandchildren and I all had our names misspelled in the book. When I pointed this out, he blamed a now-dead cousin for the mistake. No apology! May I return these unsolicited books?ust curious: Did you ever congratulate your brother-in-law on the publication of his memoir or thank him for sending two copies, or did you launch right into the misspelling of your names? Often, the tenor in which we raise problems is a good barometer for the kind of response we will receive.I’m sorry your feelings are hurt. No matter who provided the information or proofread the manuscript, it would have been thoughtful for the author to apologize. (Does anyone really need a proofreader to spell his brother’s name correctly?) Still, returning the books seems overdramatic. Your brother-in-law’s failure to apologize for minor errors probably doesn’t merit major escalation."
67,2021-06-17,"My 14-year-old son and I went to watch my younger son play in a baseball tournament. My younger son is popular and athletic; my older son is not. He’s more creative and a little effeminate. When we walked onto the field with our folding chairs, someone (I couldn’t tell who) shouted a gay slur. Some people laughed, and my son was clearly mortified. I felt frozen and unsure of what to do. And that feeling has lasted all week: I haven’t raised the issue with my son for fear of further embarrassing him, but I want him to know that I’m here for him. How should I handle this? think my heart just broke for both of you! I’ve been your son, and I’ve also been you, at different times in my life. I get the allure of pretending the bullying never happened. Please don’t do that. Speaking up can be awkward, but silence may reinforce your son’s embarrassment and shame when he has nothing to be ashamed of!The most important thing you can do as a parent is open the door for a conversation with your son when he’s ready. Just open it, though. Don’t walk through the door, don’t shout through the door — just let your son know you’re there, with love and support for him, when he’s ready to talk.Start with something simple, like: “Did you hear what that kid said when we walked in? That was really mean.” Then stop. Your son will let you know, in words or body language, if he wants to discuss it. Don’t push. It may take a while for him to open up. In the meantime, tell him you love him, and be alert for more bullying.Depending on local conditions, confiding in a sympathetic teacher or counselor may help. You can also consult a therapist or, if you think it appropriate, an L.G.B.T.Q. support group in your area. However you proceed, though, make sure your son knows he has an ally in you who supports him exactly as he is. Good luck, Mom! I’m rooting for both of you..Miguel PorlanSeating by Vaccine Status?We were invited to a wedding of the daughter of friends of 30 years. A week beforehand, the father of the bride called my husband and asked if we minded sitting at a table with an unvaccinated couple. (He said they were “anti-vaxxers.”) We said yes. We’re older and have health conditions. The father assured us the couple would not be attending. Then came the second call: “My daughter really wants this couple to be there.” My husband said we wouldn’t go, and the father thanked us. We’re flabbergasted! We want nothing more to do with these people. Thoughts, please?L.Well, the bride’s father really bobbled the ball. And I understand your distress. My guess: He really thought he could fix the problem when he told your husband he could, and he may have been surprised when his daughter insisted on including the unvaccinated couple. (It’s her wedding.)Now, we don’t know several facts: Was this an indoor event with masks? If pressed, would the hosts have found another table for you? And did they notify other guests (whose risk factors may be unknown to them) that an unvaccinated couple would be attending?I commend the bride’s father for trying, even though he failed. He shared important information. And who knows what battle ensued among the bride’s family over this? I’d hate to see you write off a friendship of 30 years over your friends’ stubborn daughter. This is new ground for all of us.First DateOn a dating app, I met a guy who seemed great. After we were both fully vaccinated, he asked me out. And I agreed. The problem: He wants to go to a movie, and I’m not comfortable with indoor theaters yet. (If it helps, I’m in my 30s and don’t have any underlying conditions.) What do you think?M.L.For starters, let me quibble with the choice of a movie for a first date: How are you going to get to know each other better sitting quietly in the dark for two hours? More important, though, is that you go at your own speed.We’ve all been through a lot during the pandemic, and if it takes you a little longer to get comfortable sitting indoors — even if it’s safe for you — wait. Is this great guy open to compromise?But You Told Me to Hurry!At the end of a long weekend, we drove our houseguests to the train station. They were running late and asked us to hurry. They didn’t want to miss their train. Cut to: We were stopped by the police for speeding. Who should pay the ticket?orry, Jim! The person behind the wheel is responsible for driving infractions. Your guests may have egged you on, but they didn’t press the accelerator. Let me add, though: Thoughtful guests would have offered to pay the ticket — or at least split it with you — under these circumstances."
68,2021-06-24,"My partner and I live on the West Coast; our families live on the East Coast. When we go home, we make detailed plans for seeing our parents to keep our visits evenly divided and fair. Over the past few years, though, when we’re visiting my family, my partner’s mother has a habit of stopping by unannounced and staying for the day. (Once, she stayed overnight!) This upsets me; she is preventing me from spending time alone with my parents. We’ve told her these days are reserved for my family, and that my parents don’t encroach on her designated time with her son, but she continues to drop by. I want her to respect my private time with my family. Any advice?--t’s tempting to conclude that your partner’s mother is a rule-breaking monster. (And she may be!) What could be fairer, after all, than dividing a six-day visit into three days with your family and three days with your partner’s? Here’s the problem, though: Sometimes neutral rules (like yours) affect people in different circumstances very differently.Let me give you an example from my marriage. My mom was a widow and a little lonely. My husband’s parents are married with an active social life. My mom needed our visits more than my in-laws did. So, we spent more time with her. Now, this may not be your situation — and more important, it may not be what you and your partner want. (That counts, too!)By your own account, you and he have clearly asked his mother to stop dropping by. So, ask again, and this time, explore why she’s having trouble respecting your request. Or maybe (and this is just an idea) you and your partner can split up briefly and spend some time with your families individually and then some time with them together. Added bonus: A mini-break from our partners (whom we love)!.Miguel PorlanSaving It for LaterMy boss regularly buys lunch for the entire staff. When he does, there is a person in the office who always orders an appetizer, entree and dessert. Everyone else just orders a sandwich or salad. One day, this person said to me: “This is dinner for me tonight!” as she ordered a meal of penne à la vodka. Is this appropriate? Why does this bother me so much?et’s start with the more interesting question: why this bothers you. I think your sense of fair play is offended by a colleague who takes advantage of your boss’s generosity. (I assume she doesn’t order three-course lunches when the company isn’t picking up the tab.) Still, if your boss doesn’t mind, why should you? I’d M.Y.O.B. here.I agree that your colleague seems grabby. On the other hand, this occasional greed may help her feel better about any number of workplace grievances. And rest assured: Your boss is being reimbursed by the company for the cost of the lunches (or they’re being deducted as a business expense on his taxes).The Noise Next DoorI am a caregiver for my husband who was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He also has leukemia and an inoperable brain tumor. Our next-door neighbors recently installed loud wind chimes very close to our house. They keep us awake day and night! My husband needs his rest, and I have to give him 30 pills a day, which is hard when I’m sleep deprived. Their house is like a fortress, so we wrote them letters (including my husband’s dire diagnoses). But nothing changed. The husband is a doctor, but they seem not to care. Ear plugs and noise machines don’t help. Any advice?’m so sorry for your troubles! Coldhearted neighbors seem like the last thing you need. For now, forget about contacting them again. Your town may have a noise ordinance. Call its administrative offices or the nonemergency number at the police department and ask if they can help you.Also, tell the medical team that’s treating your husband what’s going on. Maybe a social worker can get involved. Or perhaps someone on your husband’s medical team knows the doctor-husband and can call on your behalf. If readers have other ideas, please send them in, and I will pass them on to Andi. Good luck!Finders Keepers?Friends of mine were vacationing in a small town and waiting for a local restaurant to open. It had rained, and the street was dotted with puddles. Their teenage daughter stuck her toe in one and found a diamond ring with a good-sized stone. Her parents let her keep it. Would you consider this a “finders keepers” situation?uch to the chagrin of playground veterans, the law is often more complex than “finders keepers, losers weepers.” Our common law (the jurisprudence created by lawsuits and judges’ legal decisions) recognizes a finders keepers doctrine.But many states have passed laws that require finders to try to confirm that the property was truly abandoned — and not merely lost. This often involves police reports. So, it’s a complicated situation. (And how much could you really enjoy a ring that turned on someone else’s sadness?)"
69,2021-07-01,"A friend of mine was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The problem: She hasn’t told me. (I overheard her husband talking about it: Her illness was discovered during routine medical tests. She was having a hard time getting pregnant — which she also didn’t tell me.) I thought we were close, but I guess we’re not. Her decision to exclude me from these issues in her life hurts me and puts me in an awkward situation. What can I say if I’m not supposed to know about these big challenges she’s facing? I’m not sure how to handle this. Advice, please?K.H.Let’s start by fleshing out your real question: “I love my friend, and I’m upset that she’s facing a scary diagnosis. How can I support her if she doesn’t confide in me?” Because as long as your true goal is to help her (and not force her to confide in you), I think we can come up with a good plan.For many of us, serious diagnoses are like slaps across the face: surprising, painful, overwhelming, infuriating. And people have all kinds of reasons for sharing or withholding information about their health. Don’t take her decision as a referendum on your friendship. (It isn’t!) More important, respect her privacy. This crisis is hers to manage.My suggestion: Continue to be the best friend you can be. Check in with her; invite her to hang out. Even if she declines, she’ll probably appreciate your kindness. Never hint that you know something is up. She’ll tell you when she’s ready. Until she does, spending time with friends who don’t know about our troubles can sometimes feel like a brief vacation from them. Now, that’s a true gift of friendship!.Miguel PorlanNot in My Airspace!Our neighbor rents an apartment in his home to a young couple. They smoke on their front stoop all day. (It’s three feet from our front windows and porch, and we smell it.) We asked them nicely to move further away, but they quickly returned to the stoop. So, we keep our windows closed and stopped using the porch. Our salvation was our small backyard. But now, the owner’s adult daughter moved back home and smokes out there. Even though they have a big yard, they keep the ashtray very close to our property line. When we kindly asked the owner to move it, he became aggressive. Do we have to live in a sealed home? hate to break it to you, but creating lasting change often requires more than a single request. I think it’s reasonable to want to sit on your porch without smelling your neighbors’ cigarette smoke. Ask the young couple to move, nicely, every time you see them smoking on the stoop. Depending on the laws in your town and state, their secondhand smoke may be considered a nuisance.Your backyard tale seems different. If I understand correctly, you don’t smell smoke there; you merely object to the placement of the ashtray. (That’s a losing battle.) If you do smell smoke, though, keep looking for a compromise with your gruff neighbor. There is probably some place on his large lawn where his daughter can smoke without disturbing you.Rain Check?We were invited by friends for a weekend getaway in the country. They have a tiny bunkhouse for their family, and we will bring a tent. Cooking and other activities will take place outdoors. There will be kids and dogs and, sadly, rain. (It looks like lots of rain!) I want to ask our friends about changing dates. To me, it sounds awful being trapped in a tent with dogs and kids and nowhere to escape. But my partner thinks that’s rude: If our hosts don’t cancel, he says, we shouldn’t leave them in the lurch. Your thoughts?J.You’re in luck! You have written to a wimp. Spending the weekend trapped in a tent with soggy dogs and children sounds miserable to me, too. And unlike your partner, I see no harm in floating the idea of switching to dryer dates. If your hosts are hardier than you and I, or dead-set on that weekend, they’ll let you know and you can re-evaluate your plans.About That Letter …A few weeks ago, you answered a letter from a young woman who met a guy (who “seemed great”) on a dating app. He suggested a movie for their first date, but she was troubled by sitting indoors, even though they were both vaccinated. I am that guy! My question: Why didn’t she just tell me she was uncomfortable? It was only an idea.o you two actually want to go on a date or simply write about it forever? I didn’t read the woman’s letter as critical of you. Rather, she seemed to be asking if it was reasonable to express her discomfort, even though the venue was probably safe for both of you.I advised her to respect her feelings and suggest a different activity. I give you the same advice. Now, go on your date already!"
70,2021-07-08,"My father had a terminal illness and died recently. Throughout, there was drama between my adult siblings and our stepmother. She refused to take him to a better hospital; he told us she made him feel like an inconvenience and that she tried to stop my dad’s mother from visiting. Since his death, it’s gotten worse. My stepmother snapped at my sister that she feels like an outsider and that she was the only one there for my father. She won’t let us take anything from their house until she’s gone through everything. She refuses to pay back money my father borrowed from my brother. And she won’t divide up my father’s ashes so we can have some. My father didn’t have a will, and they were only married for a year. His last wish: that we forgive her. How?’m sorry for all of you. In an effort to help, though, I am going to do the unthinkable by speaking ill of the dead: Your father created this nasty drama, not your stepmother. For a man with grown children (and debts) to die without a will or burial plan is to invite precisely the misery that your poor family is suffering now.At any time during his illness, your father could have changed his medical proxy to one of his children or shared his wishes for his ashes. Apparently he didn’t. As for your stepmother’s complaint that she was your father’s only consistent caretaker — a physically and emotionally exhausting job — is it true? You don’t share the story of their marriage, but how awful for newlyweds to spend their first year in hospital rooms!I also know the prevalence of the evil stepmother trope. It’s more often based in misogyny, I think, than reality. Try to honor your father’s dying wish by acknowledging the sad truth: Your stepmother is an outsider without the tools or instructions to manage adult stepchildren. She is probably grief stricken — just like you. Offer to help her instead of focusing on the ways she let you down..Miguel PorlanSocially Distant FriendshipIn 2015, I became close friends with a housemate while we studied abroad. Back in the States, on different coasts, we kept in touch by text and Facebook. Before the pandemic, we were planning a visit. Last year, we connected on FaceTime and both got pandemic puppies. Since then, she hasn’t responded to texts in July and August 2020 or in January 2021. She isn’t active on Facebook. But I saw she got a promotion at work, so I know she’s . Should I let this friendship go? exting and social media are relatively passive (and frequently offhand) forms of communication. I get that they were the primary ways you spoke to your friend, but if you want to make a last-ditch effort to reach her — rather than letting the unreturned texts speak for themselves — call her. It’s more direct.If she doesn’t answer, leave a kind message that you miss her and ask her to call back when she gets a chance. She may not. But you will have done everything in your power to reconnect with her. Then try to let her go.Unhired Help?My husband and I have been friends with another couple for 10 years. Recently, they invited us to their wedding, which is in two months. After we accepted, they called and asked us to be their videographers. They said we would only have to film the ceremony, their reception entry and the “first” dances. They told us that after spending $25,000 on flowers, they were trying to save money. We’re shocked! We have no experience filming anything, nor did we ask them to work at our wedding. Do we have to agree?f course not! Many people — even the loveliest ones — can become self-absorbed about their big days. But don’t clap back. No need to mention your shock, their jumbo flower budget or the rudeness of them asking you to work the event.Just say, “We don’t feel comfortable taking on such a big responsibility. We have no experience, and we’re afraid we’d ruin your record of the day.” Then stick to your guns. They still have time to find someone else.When the Messy Adult Son Moves In …I am an artist who makes her living cleaning houses. It’s not ideal, but it lets me make art several days a week and support myself too. The problem: The young adult son of one of my best clients moved back home recently. He leaves his bedroom and bathroom in a truly disgusting state. I feel disrespected and, at the same time, reluctant to discuss the issue with his mother. What to do?C.I see no harm in raising the issue. Start by telling your client how much you value your position with her. Then ask if she’s aware of how her son leaves his bedroom and bath. If not, show her. Ask her to speak with him.It’s possible that this will not improve matters. Then you can decide whether to keep the gig (with its filthy man-child) or try to replace it."
71,2021-07-15,"I was at Lake Huron recently, and I saw two parents bullying their young son who was about 7 years old. He was refusing to jump off a giant boulder into the rocky water 15 feet below. His parents were heckling him about it, saying things like, “Thanks for not trusting me, son!” The boy looked terrified. Admittedly, there were younger kids who were jumping off the rocks. But it made me sick to my stomach to do nothing other than glare at those awful parents. Should I have said something?learly this was not a blue-ribbon day for these parents! But let’s not judge them too harshly based on this single episode — even though it may trigger terrible memories for many of us about being pushed too hard. (We’ve all had bad days and done things we regret, right?)Still, I sympathize with your desire to help a child in distress. I worry, though, that calling out parents as bullies or criticizing their behavior directly may backfire on the child. In my experience, people respond poorly to unbidden parenting advice. And the last thing we want is for them to dig in their heels.My advice for next time is to interrupt the drama by inserting yourself into the child’s role. You could say to the parents: “I was petrified of jumping off high rocks at his age. You know what helped? Practicing at lower heights until I felt more comfortable. To this day I’m grateful to my parents for their patience.” Something like that may do the trick without making it worse for the child..Miguel PorlanWhat About Me?A short time ago, my boss (an executive in a hospital system) pulled me aside and told me she was nominating me for a nursing award. I’ve been a nurse at my hospital for a decade, and I have a great reputation for giving the job my all. Today, an email went out to all employees with a lovely presentation that included a portrait of each nominee for the award and the story of why they were nominated. I was not included! I am trying to be stoic, but it hurts. I enjoyed the prospect of recognition by my employer. I’m not sure how (or whether) to approach my boss about this. Advice? ’m sorry for your hurt feelings — which are 100 percent understandable. Psychologically, it’s often harder to deal with the loss of things we were promised than those we merely hoped for.When you’re feeling confident in your ability to have a calm discussion about this, go to your boss and say: “I was surprised that I wasn’t nominated for the award after our discussion. Can you tell me what happened?”She may have been outvoted or persuaded that this was not your year. Or she may simply have dropped the ball. I know this will be easier said than done, but try to take comfort in your own knowledge that you do a great job — and that your boss merely confirmed it for you. And remember: Next year isn’t so far away!Intergenerational RelationsI am a teenager, and I’m close with my grandparents who are in their early 80s. My cousin, who is also a teenager, recently announced that they are nonbinary. They chose a new name and told us their pronouns are they/them. My grandparents fully support my cousin and usually get their name right, but they often mess up the pronouns in conversation with me. When I correct them, they look flustered and apologize forever. I hate to make them feel bad. How diligent should I be about correcting them?ractice makes perfect! I think you should keep correcting your grandparents (gently) so they are less likely to err when they talk to your cousin. I also think you should applaud them for how hard they’re trying to be supportive. (Rewiring long-held linguistic habits takes time.) They sound like terrific grandparents to me. Make sure they know you think so too.Paying for a ‘Special Experience’For my birthday, I am organizing a special experience and asking invitees to contribute $70 per person. We are all in our 30s, without children, and make good livings. This cost shouldn’t be a burden to anyone, except one friend who doesn’t earn much and has complained to me before about the cost of such celebrations. I would like to pay for her, but I’m not sure how to handle it. Thoughts? ou may, of course, give any party you like. But I am not a fan of pay-to-play events like yours. You put your friends in the awkward position of feeling like a wet blanket if they can’t afford it (despite your conclusion) or don’t want to spend $70 on your birthday or participate in the event you’ve chosen.Make sure your invitees know that you will understand entirely if this event is not their bag. As for your friend who doesn’t earn much, be direct: Tell her it would be your pleasure to treat her — but only if she wants to come."
72,2021-07-22,"I am 18 and starting college next month, which will make me the first person in my family to go. I am beyond excited! I worked very hard to get in and cover my costs. Recently, I was notified by health services that I have to show proof of my Covid-19 vaccination to enroll. The problem: My mom has been reading conspiracy theories online and is convinced that the vaccine is unnecessary and will “change my ” — whatever that means. She refuses to let me get it. Spoiler: I got vaccinated secretly months ago! (And I wish she would too.) How should I deal with my mom and the school?, !There are times, unfortunately, when we need to look out for ourselves at the expense of those we love. This is one of them! I hope you tried to convince your mother (with data) that the available vaccines were tested rigorously and judged safe by scientists who are competent to make that call. The fact that unvaccinated people account for the vast majority of Covid hospitalizations and deaths is another powerful argument.You are unlikely to persuade her, though, if her mind is closed to reason. If your mother is contributing to the cost of your education, which you say you took pains to cover, or if you plan to continue living at home, keep up the act. You can’t undo your vaccination, and the consequences of your mother’s reaction may derail your education.Bring proof of your vaccination to college when you enroll. If necessary, call health services in advance to explain your predicament. If your mother asks, tell her the school gave you an exemption. I’m sorry that your achievement is being overshadowed by your mother’s misinformation. Let me hear back from you if you need help, ?.Miguel PorlanIn Case Your Plans Change …My daughter’s bat mitzvah is coming up this fall. In discussing our plans for the gathering with family and friends, I learned that a few won’t be able to make it. Some have Covid-related travel concerns; others have conflicting engagements. I don’t think I should send invitations to these people. Why make them refuse me, formally, a second time? I also think that invitations to these people would seem like gift grabs. Several family members differ. You? agree with you — for the most part. Sending invitations to people who have already told you they aren’t available seems redundant and possibly guilt-inducing. Plans (and comfort levels) can change, though.Here’s what I suggest: Instead of invitations, send short notes to the people who’ve told you they can’t come, letting them know they will be missed and asking them to let you know if they find themselves available after all. Don’t waste time worrying about gift grabs: Gifts are always optional.Paper TrailMy sister died recently — far too young! It fell to me to go through her small house and attic. Fortunately, she was well-organized. She had created a list of recipients of various items. But I came upon a few boxes that stumped me. One was filled with photographs of her with a childhood friend whom she’d argued with. The other was a cache of fairly recent love letters from a man whose name and address are on the envelopes. Unlike her other possessions, she provided no instructions for these things. The family historian in me hates to throw them away. What would you do?’m sorry for your loss (and admire your conscientiousness). When it comes to distributing the personal effects of others, I subscribe to the “do no harm” doctrine. It’s hard to imagine that childhood photographs would cause difficulty for your sister’s friend. They may even be healing for her. Send them!Be more cautious, though, about the love letters. If your sister had wanted them returned, it seems as if she would have said so. Her lover may have been married or unavailable during their correspondence. He may still be! If you are inclined to return the letters, try contacting the man first by phone to ask if he wants them back.Gluten Insensitivity?A friend has been eating gluten-free for years. She doesn’t have celiac disease, but she feels better without gluten in her diet. I always accommodate her when I host a meal or event. But when I am not the host — and feel like bringing a batch of novelty cupcakes as a hostess gift, for instance — she becomes visibly annoyed when she learns my gifts are not gluten-free. What are my obligations to her when I’m not the host?s a guest, you are obviously not responsible for the dietary restrictions of other guests. And “visible annoyance” seems like a strong reaction to a hostess gift for someone else. Still, if you are reading your friend correctly, wouldn’t it be better to smooth over her hurt feelings than to explain your obligations to her?Say, “I thought the cupcakes were cute. But they didn’t have a gluten-free option. Sorry!” It costs you nearly nothing. And it’s good to be a sensitive friend."
73,2021-07-29,"My sister separated from her husband and moved across the country. Her teenage son did not want to go with her or live with his father, so she asked me to convert an unused floor of my house into a place for him to stay. I explained that I couldn’t afford to do that. So, she agreed to reimburse me for the renovations, which cost $10,000. I charged the full amount to my credit cards, and her son moved in. Now, my sister refuses to repay me — claiming she never made the agreement! She even got our elderly father involved and called me a liar. I am broke from the pandemic and need the money. She is wealthy. What can I do?et’s put to one side your underlying issues with your sister. We’re unlikely to fix them here. And it seems doubtful to me that further discussion with her will resolve the renovation conflict. The real issue here is this: You spent money you don’t have for your nephew’s, and your sister’s, benefit.As for her claim that you’re lying: Is there any chance you have proof, in your emails, text messages and other writings, of the deal your sister agreed to? If not, let this be a lesson: Material agreements should be put in writing — even those with immediate family members!Go to your sister’s ex and your father and tell them you spent $10,000, at your sister’s request, on a bedroom suite for your nephew and that you desperately need repayment. Maybe they will pony up. If not, notify your sister and her ex that their son will be evicted immediately unless you are repaid in full. I don’t see an easy solution to your family problems, but a lodger may help with your money troubles..Miguel PorlanThe Ragers Next DoorI live with my family in a small town that includes many people with weekend homes. The weekenders tend to use their places mostly in the summer. We have one right next door, and I thought we had a good relationship. But recently, he began listing his house on Airbnb as a great place for parties. We’ve had a succession of weekend renters next door, giving loud parties that often last until 2 or 3 in the morning and keep us (and our children) awake. Our town has no ordinance preventing short-term rentals, and I don’t like calling the police every weekend about the noise. What would you do?he saddest thing (to me) about innovations like Airbnb is how often they destroy our belief that our neighbors care about us. (Or that they care about us only until someone is willing to pay them a few hundred bucks.) Then there’s the noise!Call your neighbor and explain calmly what his Airbnb renters are putting your family through. Ask him to stop it, or at least to edit his listing to cater to quieter tenants. I know it seems unlikely to you, but he may not have given much thought to what his new income stream is costing others.I get that it’s no fun to call the police about noisy parties. But I don’t see an alternative here unless you’re willing to walk next door every weekend to ask strangers (who probably care little about your quality of life) to turn down their music.No Vaccine? No Invite.I have an extra ticket to an outdoor concert, and I invited a friend who I assumed was vaccinated against Covid-19. He recently told me that he’s not. Even though we will be outdoors, I don’t feel comfortable sitting next to someone who is unvaccinated for three hours. How can I politely disinvite him?e direct: “Even though the concert is outdoors, I don’t feel safe sitting next to you for such a long stretch. I don’t want to risk a breakthrough infection. I hope you’ll understand that I am going to invite someone else to come with me.”Remember, though, you know nothing about the person who will be sitting on the other side of you for several hours. He or she may be unvaccinated too! This is one of the worst knock-on effects of irrational vaccine hesitancy: It is chilling the resumption of normal activities that would be safer for everyone if people (who are medically able) simply got themselves vaccinated.How to Be a Good GuestI am tired of going to birthday parties where the host has requested “no gifts, please,” just to be the only person who doesn’t bring a gift. How do you handle this?imple: I don’t bring gifts! And neither should you. If hosts are willing to flout the old-time etiquette taboo of mentioning gifts on invitations, the least we can do, as guests, is to respect their wishes.Try not to compare your choice to what other people are doing. Comparison, as the wise saying goes, is the thief of joy. (It is also responsible for millions of last-minute purchases of undistinguished wine and smelly candles.)"
74,2021-08-05,"My son died nine years ago from an opioid overdose. He was bipolar and trying to get on with his life after college, but he hit a rough patch, made some poor choices and was gone. I have gotten grief counseling, and I’m better. The problem is my stepchildren. In the middle of celebrations of big events in their lives — weddings, births, job promotions — I am often seized with grief that my son is not there and will never be doing these things. My habit has been to leave the events quietly and let my husband spend happy times with the kids. But recently, my stepdaughter told me that my sudden absences are casting a pall over their lives. They think it’s time for me to move beyond my grief. I am confused and hurt by this. Advice?’m sorry for the loss of your son. As you well know, without my telling you, grief takes its own shape and time. And the pain of some losses never disappears entirely. Count your stepchildren lucky that they seem to have been spared this knowledge so far.Still, it sounds as if you may benefit from additional grief counseling or a support group. After nearly a decade of mourning your son, you may find it healing to work toward fuller participation in joyful occasions without losing yourself in sadness.I can also see — and I bet you can too — that leaving your stepchildren’s parties may be hurtful to them. Instead of thinking of them as selfish or insensitive, can you take some consolation in how much they value your presence?For the moment, tell them you are doing the best you can. (No one can ask more of you than that!) Then offer them a choice: You will stay at events for as long as you are able, or you will sit them out entirely if your leaving upsets them. It’s not a perfect solution, but it may be the best you can do for now..Miguel PorlanDining Out Without MeA friend of mine messages me all the time for restaurant suggestions when he goes out to eat. But he never asks me to join. True to Social Q’s standards, I advise him gladly and without expectation. But it seems odd to me. Should I ask him about this?M.You can, but only after you reframe the problem: Your friend clearly respects you (and your palate), as well as your judgment about dining out. That’s a compliment! He has also fallen into a lazy habit of using you as a go-to resource. (That happens.)Help him break the habit in a way that doesn’t shame him. Say, “I’m flattered that you respect my opinion! Next time, let’s all go out together.” This may help reset your relationship and remind him that you are an actual person — not merely an aggregator of restaurant reviews.So Much for the Nice Party I Planned!A dear friend and her husband are moving out of state in a few weeks. I offered to host a small going-away party for them, and they accepted. Now, three days before the party, my friend asked me to cancel it. She said she doesn’t have the bandwidth to help with the party, and she suggested that we all meet at a local bar instead. But I hadn’t asked for any help! I was excited to do this for her as a gesture of friendship. I am confused and hurt. How do I show up at the bar with a smile on my face? understand how you feel. It’s not unheard-of, though, for good deeds to take surprising bounces. And here, where your friend is facing the daunting task of uprooting her life and starting over in a new place, she may be feeling anxious and overwhelmed. Try not to add to her burden.Being at the center of a small house party may feel more stressful to her than grabbing drinks at a local bar. (I’m sure your pal didn’t mean to insult you by suggesting you needed her help to give a party.) So, walk into the bar knowing that she feels close enough to you to tell you what she needs. You must be great friends for her to do that!Still Swiping?Now that we are (sort of) able to date safely again, I have re-upped my profiles on the dating apps. I’ve gone out with this one guy three times, and we seem to have a great sexual and psychological connection. But his profile is still active on the app where we met. Can I ask him when he plans to take it down?ot even close! Three dates are far too few to make any conclusive assessments about your connection — sexual, psychological or otherwise. Relationships are about sustaining and strengthening these early indications over time.I get your impatience. But tamp it down. After you’ve been seeing this guy steadily for a few months, you may broach the subject of dating apps. (And do yourself a favor: Don’t torture yourself by clicking on his profile endlessly!)"
75,2021-09-10,"My husband’s brother and sister-in-law are hosting an indoor wedding for another relative. They live in an area with a high rate of Covid-19 transmission, and we learned recently that they’ve chosen not to be vaccinated. More than 50 people are attending the event, including older, vulnerable relatives and a pregnant woman. (We have an 8-month-old baby.) Masks are not required. We are the only people who know the hosts are unvaccinated, and they were clearly upset when we asked about it. My husband and I are vaccinated, but of course our baby is not. Given the dangers of the Delta variant, should we tell other guests about our hosts’ vaccination status? Can we possibly bring our baby?he challenge of thorny problems like yours is finding a way to be helpful without acting as if we’re more powerful than we are. Yes, you and your husband may be the only ones who know the hosts’ vaccination status. But isn’t that simply because you asked them? Your best approach here is to encourage other guests to do the same. Let’s normalize sensible questions!All invitees to social events should feel comfortable asking about the vaccination status of other attendees, as well as the safety precautions that will be in place. (The Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness, but a small percentage of fully vaccinated people have experienced breakthrough cases.) If hosts are annoyed by reasonable questions, that’s their problem — not yours.As for attending the wedding (with or without your baby), ask your doctor about indoor parties with unvaccinated, unmasked people. (She or he will not recommend them.)If you want to discuss Covid risk with other invitees, don’t tell them what to do. (That doesn’t help with their next invitation.) Encourage them to create their own decision-making strategies guided by science. As long as a substantial minority of our population refuses to be vaccinated and dangerous variants circulate, making such risk assessments will be part of our daily lives..Miguel PorlanMoney, Please!Increasingly, my friends post birthday requests on Facebook, asking us to make donations in their honor to one of their favorite charities. As a retiree who lives on Social Security and a small pension, I am embarrassed that I can’t afford to honor the growing number of requests I receive from Facebook friends. I also believe these requests come with an unspoken challenge to prove that I value our relationship by making a donation. Is there a solution to my discomfort?he solution here may require a reassessment of your circumstances, Michael. You worked hard throughout your adult life and created a secure retirement for yourself. This should be a matter of pride, not shame!I hope you’re wrong about your friends’ “unspoken challenges” to prove your friendship by donation. There’s no evidence of it here. Call or write to your friends on their birthdays. Tell them how much they mean to you — and why. True friends will cherish that gift.Texting EtiquetteI play in a tennis league of eight women (two courts of doubles). Recently, a couple of members texted the group about 40 minutes before we were scheduled to meet, asking that we push the start time back 30 minutes. Four responded; two never saw the texts. (One was busy, and the other was already driving to the courts.) One of the original texters apologized, but the other’s attitude was more like: “Why didn’t you check your phone?” Has the digital age changed what constitutes notice and good manners?ong before cellphones, there were minor emergencies. Back then, a person would call around wildly trying to reach everyone in advance and get their  for a later start time. Today, cellphones and group texts make it easier to notify everyone more quickly and (hopefully) win their agreement.Here, the notice was clearly insufficient. One of the players was already driving to the courts! The other sounds less tethered to her phone than many of us. Sadly, I can’t dictate a precise window for polite notice. Try for a couple of hours at least. (Still, if your kid has to be picked up from the nurse’s office, there’s not much to be done about it — other than to apologize later.)The Sneezes Say It AllMy girlfriend adopted a mutt from our local animal shelter. (It’s an adorable dog!) But she tells friends who complain of having pet allergies that her dog is hypoallergenic when, in fact, she has no idea if it is. What should I do when this situation arises? Would it be disloyal to speak up?o far, your girlfriend sounds less adorable than her dog. Allergies to pet dander can be extremely serious. And it is not your girlfriend’s prerogative to make health choices for other people. (Also, dishonest friends are the worst!) Tell her that her baseless claim about her dog is a serious health risk, and if the issue comes up again, you will be honest with your friends. This may do the trick!"
76,2021-08-19,"I am staying with my parents until I go back to college in September. A few days ago, while I was driving home — way below the speed limit! — the neighbors’ dog darted into the street. (It looked like he was chasing something.) I slammed on my brakes and felt a thud. I got out of the car and saw that I had hit the dog. He was dead. I carried him to my neighbors’ house, but no one was home. So, I left him on the doorstep. I was going to write a note, but I chickened out. Now, the neighbors have posted signs around the neighborhood asking if anyone knows what happened. I feel terrible! Is it too late to speak up?t’s never too late to do the right thing. (You know that!) I get that you panicked in the moment. By not telling your neighbors, though, you have added needlessly to their anguish. Can you imagine coming home to a beloved pet lying mysteriously dead at your door? Still, I’m glad you wrote. Let’s think of this as the first step in redeeming yourself.Tell your parents what happened. (They will continue living near your neighbors after you return to college.) If, for any reason, they ask you to keep quiet about the accident, tell them you can’t do that. Speaking up will be better (and more healing) for you and your neighbors.Then go next door and tell them what happened. Do not embroider your account with excuses: The dog bolted into the street. You hit him. He was dead. They were away. Then apologize sincerely for the accident, your failure to speak up earlier and the pain you’ve caused them. I have no idea how they will respond, but I am certain that this is the right and kindest thing to do..Miguel PorlanOn Again, Off AgainIn 1972, one year after graduating from high school, my best friend dumped me. He never said why. At our 10th reunion, he ignored me rudely. Last week, after 49 years of silence, he sent me an email asking if I was going to our 50th reunion. He wanted to catch up. I told him I wasn’t going, but I asked about his life, which he described in great detail. He wrote about his sexual exploits as if he were still 17. In return, I sent him a Playbill from a Jefferson Airplane concert we attended together 50 years ago. Weeks later, I still haven’t heard from him. This hits a nerve. Am I wrong?f course you’re not wrong! I’m sorry your friend hurt your feelings 49 years ago, 39 years ago and last week. You see the pattern, though, right? If you think it may help, call him and tell him (calmly) how his behavior has made you feel.I worry that this may be an unsatisfying encounter, though. (A 70-year-old who brags about his sex life, after 50 years of silence, doesn’t sound like great friendship material.) Instead, can you use this opportunity to reflect on, and appreciate, the people who have been there for you? That may be more useful.Coffee?I recently started a new job at a large company. We’re working remotely until Labor Day. Still, I’ve started coming into the office voluntarily. I love my new standing desk! Occasionally, I exchange emails with co-workers who say they’re in the office too. I’d like to ask if I can stop by and meet them in person. I’m fully vaccinated, and we’re required to wear masks when moving around the building. Still, I work in a senior role, and some colleagues may be reluctant to refuse me. I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. What do you think?-t’s great that you’re being sensitive to some people’s reluctance to meet in person these days, as well as the power dynamics at play. If these colleagues feel comfortable going into an office, though, they may be open to meeting you. Just be sure to give them the information they need to decide and an easy out.Say: “I’m in the office too! May I stop by to say hi or meet you outdoors, if you prefer? I’m fully vaccinated and masked, but I understand entirely if you’d rather keep it virtual for now.” Volunteering the necessary information (without making them work for it) and respecting other people’s boundaries is likely to make you a welcome new colleague.To Disinvite, or Not to Disinvite …I have an extra ticket to Shakespeare in the Park. I’m excited to go to the theater again! The friend I invited accepted. She said she hates Shakespeare, but she’d love to see me and hang out in Central Park. I’d rather go with someone who likes Shakespeare. What can I do?t’s tricky to rescind an invitation you’ve already made. I see some wiggle room here, though. Say, “If it’s  with you, I’m going to invite someone who likes Shakespeare to come to the play with me. Can you hang out in the park the following week?” Hopefully, this will work for both of you."
77,2021-08-26,"I am one of two maids of honor at a close friend’s upcoming wedding. Because of Covid-19 public health orders in her state, she has had to postpone the event twice. We’re finally approaching the re-rescheduled date. The couple is hosting an indoor ceremony with 200 guests (no masks or vaccination required) and a tented outdoor reception. My partner and I are traveling from California. We’re vaccinated but uncomfortable spending time indoors with others who are unmasked or potentially unvaccinated — especially when breakthrough infections are making some people very sick. Would it be tacky as a maid of honor to wear a mask throughout the evening? Will people think we’re overcautious?  e are in a public health crisis, Maid of Honor! Protecting your health (and the health of others) completely dwarfs wedding attire. Instead of worrying about what other people think of your sensible mask, perhaps you can use your close relationship with the bride to help make her wedding safer for everyone. Because 200 people gathered indoors — without masks, social distance and possibly vaccinations — sounds more like a superspreader event than a joyful occasion.Before speaking to your close friend, try to appreciate her (totally legitimate!) sadness and frustration at multiple postponements of her wedding. Don’t get me wrong: Party planning is small potatoes compared with serious illness and death. But you can still empathize with the bridal couple’s challenges. This sets the stage for a warmer conversation.Then call her. “I love you and feel terrible about how hard this wedding has been on you. But with the growing number of Delta variant infections, wouldn’t it be smarter to move the wedding outdoors? And requiring vaccinations and masks would make it safer for everyone. Will you think about it?”The bride may be angry — or she may agree! In the end, the decision to attend and wear a mask is yours. Personally, I can’t imagine disregarding the advice of the C.D.C. to avoid large indoor gatherings. Like it or not, we stake our good health (and possibly our lives) on smart risk assessment now. I leave it to you to make the call and to sympathize with your friend..Miguel PorlanPregnancy Test?I think a friend of mine may be pregnant. We’re friendly, but not s. She hasn’t said anything to me about it, but I can see the shape of her body changing. How terrible would it be to invite her to dinner and serve ceviche? (Pregnant women can’t eat raw fish.) If she doesn’t eat it, that would be another piece of evidence. Can I?G.F.Request denied! Your plan is manipulative — and inconclusive. We are each entitled to share personal information (that does not affect others) at our own pace, regardless of other people’s curiosity. Also, you overlook the distinct possibility that your friend may not care for raw fish cured in citrus juices and still not be pregnant. Respect her privacy. When she has something to tell you, she will.Pitfalls of Grieving OnlineI am a part-time music influencer with several hundred followers on Spotify. My grandfather died recently in a freak accident. We’re all in shock. I was very close with him and I’m grief-stricken. To help myself cope, I made a playlist of songs about loss and grief. Stupidly, I made this playlist public — with my usual custom cover art and Gen Z-friendly song descriptions. Now, I worry that it looks like I’m trying to profit off my loss to gain likes and followers. I loved my grandfather dearly, and I hate to think I’m being disrespectful. Any advice? applaud your sensitivity to the optics of this situation, but I think you’re overlooking an important fact: Your playlist may help others, like you, who are grieving. That’s a wonderful tribute to your grandfather!I suggest revising your playlist description to make its origin and purpose clearer to your followers. Maybe replace the cover art with a special photograph of your grandfather and embroider song descriptions with memories of him.I get that generating income is one of the reasons you became a music influencer. But I bet your love of music — and your emotional connection to it — is a bigger one. Invite your followers to share their painful losses, too. Personally, I see you doing lots of good here. Don’t be hard on yourself!Care for an Egg?My mom and sister are helping me move to college. The car will be packed, so it’s a tight squeeze for the three of us. My sister insists on bringing hard-boiled eggs for a snack on the road. But hard-boiled eggs smell awful to me and tend to make me nauseated. I asked her to bring something else, but she won’t budge. Any ideas?et’s find a compromise. Your sister is helping you move, an occasion for gratitude. Still, feeling nauseated on long drives is a big bummer. How about this: Your sister limits her egg intake to pit stops? She exits the car to peel and eat them, then washes her hands and pops breath mints as necessary. Totally doable, right?"
78,2021-09-02,"My ex-husband invited our 19-year-old daughter to spend a long weekend in Las Vegas with him, his wife and their children. She was excited to go. She asked him how to pack, in case she needed dressy clothes. He told her to pack for hot weather and outdoor activities. After arriving, she discovered they weren’t going to Las Vegas at all. They drove to Zion National Park for several days of hiking. But my daughter has heat-induced asthma, and her father knows this! Hiking in 107-degree heat is a health risk for her. When she asked to stop, they refused and she was raised not to argue with them. So she overused her rescue inhaler. Later, she discovered they intentionally misled her about the trip because they feared she wouldn’t come, and they wanted a family picture for their Christmas card. Please tell me I can call them out? get your distress, Mom. But I am much more concerned that your young adult daughter has been raised, as you say, to acquiesce to the demands of others rather than to look out for her own well-being. Your (justified) anger about this single episode is small potatoes compared with that.For you to call out your ex (or anyone else) who pushes your daughter into unsafe activities — after the fact! — does nothing to help her learn to navigate these challenges for herself. And that is the essence of adulthood. Don’t get me wrong: I get the pleasure of screaming down the phone, but that’s not your first order of business here.Talk to your daughter: “Honey, it’s never selfish to prioritize taking care of yourself over making other people happy. I may not have told you that enough. Put yourself and your safety first, and say no when people ask for things that aren’t right for you.”Then talk through some smarter choices she could have made over the weekend: explaining the serious health risks to her of hiking in extreme heat; staying at the lodge; or even calling you for help with an early departure if her father and stepmother continued to be unreasonable. Your role is to prepare your daughter for the world, not to fight her battles for her..Miguel PorlanI’m Not Fine, ThanksLast month, I lost my partner of 42 years. I feel broken. When I run into people who know about my partner’s death — friends or neighbors, for instance — they ask me: “So, how are you doing?” I reply honestly, which is to say: “Not very well,” or sometimes I just shake my head. This almost always results in the other person looking uncomfortable. I don’t want to make anyone feel awkward, but I think replying honestly is part of my healing process. I don’t want to say, “I’m fine, thanks.” I’m not. Is there a gracious response that would avoid awkwardness?’m so sorry for your loss. I’d like to help you reframe this issue. Your challenge right now is to get through one of the worst periods of your life, not to make it more palatable to random bystanders. “How are you?” How do they think you are 30 days after losing your partner of four decades?Try to ignore the seeming discomfort of friends and neighbors at your honest responses. (It’s not important.) Keep the focus on you and your feelings. If you believe strongly in making others feel at ease, you can elaborate slightly: “I’m not doing well now, but I’m taking it one day at a time.” There’s hope in that.That GuyMy family is planning a milestone birthday for my father, and the entire extended family (all vaccinated and tested) is expected to attend. My mother has hired a professional photographer to take family photos. One of my daughters, in her late 20s, is bringing her serious boyfriend of six months. Should he be included in the family photos?onsult your daughter. Tell her you want to respect her relationship, but you don’t want to put pressure on it. Then ask her how she’d like to handle family photographs, maybe including the boyfriend in some, but not others. Err on the side of inclusion, though. You don’t want to hurt her. Your relationship with her is more important than photographs.I Have the Card, but Where’s the Gift?A grateful client gave my co-worker and me $100 gift cards to a local restaurant. When we tried to use them, we were told they had no value. I am absolutely certain that our client bought them in good faith. At the same time, we would hate to make her feel bad about this. Should we tell her, or is it better to keep quiet?efinitely tell her about the mishap! But make sure you do so in the context of thanking her for her generous gift. Problems with gift cards are not uncommon. If she calls the restaurant manager and explains the issue (with her credit card statement in hand), that will probably clear things up. Think of it like this: If you were her, would you want to throw away $200 because of a technical glitch?"
79,2021-09-09,"My employer doesn’t require masks in the office, and most people don’t wear them — even in meeting rooms where social distancing is impossible. Still, I wear a mask, and I’d feel better if my colleagues did too. We returned to the office in June, before the Delta variant became widespread in my state and Covid infection rates were low. I’m vaccinated, but the vaccination rate is low in my area. (And our employer says we shouldn’t ask co-workers if they are vaccinated.) Is there a way to ask co-workers to wear masks in the office? I have young children who aren’t eligible for vaccination, and I want to keep them safe. can only imagine the anxiety of going into a physical workplace, every day, without vaccination or mask requirements while Delta variant infections continue to rise in many parts of the world. You are wise to wear a mask, Sarah, but we are better protected when all parties in tight, indoor spaces do.Still, I wouldn’t try to persuade your co-workers to wear masks one by one. It’s a collegial impulse, but there’s too much at stake here. Go to your boss, instead: “We came back to the office during the brief window between widespread vaccination for Covid-19 and the arrival of the Delta variant. I think our changed circumstances require the company to rethink its policies on vaccines and masks. Will you consider that?”Keep your tone respectful. This will underscore your sincere concern for the health of all employees and their loved ones. Your company is not responsible for the nasty polarization of common-sense measures like vaccines and masking. But that doesn’t take it off the hook, either. If you don’t make any progress, ask about working remotely — or at least skipping meetings where social distancing is impossible..Miguel PorlanNo Gifts for You!My husband and I have been married for 34 years and have no children. We have sent many expensive gifts to our cousins and their children over the years to celebrate holidays and all kinds of special occasions. We have not received many gifts in return. And I can count on one hand the number of thank-you notes we’ve received. (We don’t even get emails or texts that acknowledge receipt!) Should I stop sending gifts to these ungrateful relatives or try to convince myself that they have not been trained in good manners?or years now, I have written that we should give gifts because we want to express affection for their recipients in material terms — not to be thanked for them. But let me add quickly that one of the surest ways to kill that desire is to have our gifts ignored. (And once the ugly realization sets in, it is very hard to dismiss!)The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated Oct. 14, 2021, 1:05 p.m. iden calls on businesses to ‘step up’ as he expresses optimism about the fight against the virus.Here’s the expert panel that will vote on Moderna and J.& J. booster shots.Six out of seven coronavirus cases in Africa are going undetected, the W.H.O. says.Now, you don’t say anything about your relationships with these cousins. If they are loving and kind to you in all ways but thank-you notes, you may be able to overlook the omission (or even ask for acknowledgment of your gifts). But if your presents are the centerpiece of these relationships, you are free to stop sending them.Leave It in the Past?I have a solid relationship with my live-in boyfriend’s ex-wife. We have a group text (consisting of him, her and me) to arrange drop-off and pickup of their son. Occasionally, she texts pictures of my boyfriend and his son from when she was married to him: intimate photos that show a loving relationship between father and son. I would rather not see them. I acknowledge that he had a life before me, but the pictures make me feel vulnerable and sad. Still, I value my relationship with the ex. Is it worth risking it by asking her not to text these photos? sympathize with your feelings; this is a little weird. If I understand correctly, though, the ex doesn’t appear in the photos. So, try to let this slide. Your boyfriend may cherish these images with his son! And you don’t suggest the ex has an ulterior motive here. (She’s sharing these pictures with you, too, and they show your boyfriend as a loving father.) If you want reassurance about your relationship, better to get it from your boyfriend than to censor his ex.Family FirstMy husband and I work hard during the week. So, our weekends with our two young kids are precious to us. We love for all four of us to get into our pool together and talk and play games. But this summer, a young family moved in next door, and the wife is pretty aggressive about walking up to our pool fence and asking if her family can join us. How do I say no?C.R.Easy! Just tell her privately what you wrote to me: “My husband and I work long hours, and our family time on the weekend is precious to us. We’ll give you a call when we’d like you to join us for a swim, ?”Try not to hold this against her. She may be pushier than many of us, but she may still turn out to be an excellent neighbor."
80,2021-09-16,"I am in my late 30s and have a good relationship with my parents. We speak on the phone weekly. Last Sunday, my mother informed me that they gave my sister a chunk of money to help with a down payment on a house. She told me I wouldn’t receive a matching sum because my husband and I already own a house and his parents gave us a generous gift when we were buying it. My parents aren’t wealthy, so I understand their decision. Still, it stings! I think my parents are making assumptions about my financial position. I also believe their choice to give money to my younger sister is a declaration of greater love for her. Should I bring this up again?ou should definitely bring it up if this gift is going to interfere with your relationship with your parents or your sister. (I can’t tell if this is a passing sting or one that may lead to lasting resentment.) Before you do, though, consider a few points to make the conversation more productive.Our parents’ money is theirs. Whether they are fabulously rich or just squeaking by, they can spend it however they like. And adult children have no entitlement to it. Here, for instance, your parents decided they wanted both daughters to enjoy the economic advantages of homeownership. This meant giving money to one child but not to another (who already owns a home). Broadly speaking, they put you in the same position.Still, I am sympathetic with your feelings. Sibling rivalry for parental love can be painful. So, while I recommend talking to your parents, it’s not to air a grievance. It’s to let them know that your feelings are hurt by your (likely false!) perception that their gift to your sister signals greater love for her.Add quickly that you understand their decision and aren’t trying to wheedle a gift out of them. You simply want to be open with them. I hope the ensuing conversation reassures you. (And for parents: If you intend to make unequal gifts, it can be helpful to discuss the issue in advance. Feelings about parental gifts can run strong!).Miguel PorlanAbout Your Son’s Mask …My daughter started second grade in a school with a mask requirement and a classroom where children are seated alphabetically. She sits next to a boy whose mask, she says, is often pulled down or not fitted properly over his nose and mouth. She told her teacher, but the problem continues. Would it be  for me to call the boy’s parents (whom I don’t know) directly?et me first apologize to your daughter’s overworked and underpaid teachers before I add “mask monitor” to their job description. But you should really speak to them instead. This may spark a useful classroom exercise about the importance of masks and the proper way to wear them. (If the boy’s mask doesn’t fit properly, the teacher can address that too.) Contact the principal if the problem persists.Ensuring the safety of your child is important. The problem you describe, though, is probably more widespread than a single boy. Issues that arise in school (and involve young children) are often best mediated there by an adult who has witnessed the events.But I Brought a Generous Gift!I have hosted and attended many bridal showers. Lately, I’ve noticed that hosts frequently ask attendees to pay a flat fee to cover the costs of food, drink, décor, party favors, etc. I’d like to think I’m generous. I have no issue covering my food, drinks or special activities, but it irks me to be asked to pay for things like party favors. Am I cheap, or should hosts incur some costs?K.Traditionally, the maid of honor or all bridesmaids host (and pay!) for the bridal shower. But I, too, have noticed the trend toward pay-to-play bridal showers, birthday parties and other occasions, where hosts ask attendees to pay their share of the total costs. I can’t tell you why this has happened. Perhaps parties have grown more lavish, hosts have grown poorer or online payments have become extremely easy.I don’t think you’re cheap — and I’m certain I will receive several (very angry) letters about hosts asking guests to chip in. Maybe the best way to think about this, though, is that our culture is always changing, and so are its parties. No one is forcing hosts to spread costs among guests, and invitees can always refuse invitations they don’t like. But for many this particular ship has already sailed.Where’s My Sandwich?At least once a week, someone steals my sandwich from the communal fridge in our office break room. I bring lunch to save money, so it’s doubly annoying that I have to pay for two! How do you feel about notes on refrigerator doors asking thieves to cease and desist?t can’t hurt, right? If the person taking your sandwich is a hardened thief, a note will probably have little effect. But if this person is doing the wrong thing without thinking about it, maybe clouded by laziness or hunger, your note may help: “I’m hungry too! Please don’t steal my sandwich.”"
81,2021-09-23,"As soon as everyone was vaccinated, we invited my family to our home for a holiday meal outdoors. We also included my brother-in-law, who is my wife’s only living relative and has nowhere else to go. My own brother expressed surprise at this: Unbeknown to us, my brother-in-law had unfriended us on Facebook and posted a rant accusing us of elder abuse that led to his mother’s death. (We cared for her in our home until she died, and I’m proud of the years we took care of her.) Knowing this, I would like to disinvite him. But my wife says that she’s ignored similarly awful statements from him in the past, and there’s no point in arguing with him: He never admits he’s wrong. What should we do?n my experience, people occasionally say horrible things after the death of a loved one. It’s often the grief talking; it can warp rational thought. And now, thanks to social media, we can broadcast our cruelest takes, hatched at the peak of anguish, to nearly everyone we know. This is not an excuse, merely a possibility.Still, like you, I would not relish entertaining someone who thinks I murdered his mother. Your wife seems to take a different view, though. She may have greater faith that her brother doesn’t really believe what he said. She also may feel it isn’t worth the fight to get her stubborn sibling — whom she wants to keep in her life — to recant.Try to defer to your wife here. Ask her, “Do you really want your brother to come?” If she does, include him as an act of love for her. She may also authorize a conversation with him in advance: “Your ugly post about our treatment of your mother really hurt us. But your sister loves you and wants you to come.” This way, you let him know where he stands without trying to wrestle an apology out of him..Miguel PorlanSay More About That …If someone tells you they’ve had surgery or been ill, is it rude to ask for details, such as the nature of the illness? My sister says it is: If the person wanted to tell you, they would volunteer the information. I see her point, but perhaps the person doesn’t want to give more details unless we express interest in them. Not everyone wants to know. So, is it more polite to say, “May I ask what the illness was?” Or is it better to leave it alone?ou and your sister offer plausible readings of an encounter. Balancing the risks, though, I would go with her approach. It is kinder to respect people’s privacy about health matters (that don’t affect us) and to avoid asking them to recount possibly traumatic events than it is to pose potentially unwanted follow-up questions.A general statement of support (“I’m sorry for your troubles”) works fine. And with close friends, you may add: “I’m here to talk if you want to.” This has the additional benefit of putting the person who was ill in charge of the conversation.No Strings Attached?I started hanging out with this girl I met online a few months ago. Since then, she’s sort of implied that she thinks we’re seeing each other exclusively, but we never had that conversation. I am not seeing her exclusively, and I don’t want to. Can I keep on seeing other people until we actually have the discussion and reach an agreement about it?D.J.Simply asking the question indicates that you know what the right answer is. Now that you’re aware that this woman misunderstands the nature of your commitment to her — even if it’s through no fault of your own — you owe her the truth.This may lead to a conversation that will end your time hanging out together. (Or it may not!) But being honest with our intimate partners, even when they jump to the wrong conclusion on their own, is essential to maintaining any kind of relationship, exclusive or not. Speak up!Just a DabAn artist friend offered to make a painting for my new home. I don’t love her work, but I wanted to be supportive, so I agreed. Unfortunately, the abstract painting she gave me looks like something you’d find in a generic hotel hallway. I’ve never hung it. But I have thought I might really enjoy the painting if I could make some amateur, lighthearted changes to it. Would that be ?echnically, the painting is your property to do with as you like, and you are free to alter it. That would be an act of disloyalty to your friend, though, who gave you her artwork as a sincere gesture of friendship.Taste is a personal matter; respect for our friends is not. Here, I see no reason to offer a critique of her painting or to deface it, which you know would likely hurt her. Just thank her for her gift, then store it, donate it or give it a friend — as is."
82,2021-09-30,"In January, my husband’s sister drove cross-country to help care for our two young sons while my husband was deployed in the armed services. When I proposed the idea, I asked her to think about the pay she would like and the services she would provide. I told her we would cover her room and board. She never responded. After she arrived, I asked her several more times about pay and duties. She said she preferred an informal arrangement. Since then, she has helped out when she liked. Now, she is ready to drive home again and has asked for back pay. We are so grateful she came, but if I’d known I was paying her, I would have formalized her duties instead of accepting piecemeal help. What should I do?--hort of telling your sister-in-law at the outset that you were uncomfortable with the “informal arrangement” she preferred, which may have made you seem demanding, I don’t see how you could have averted your current fix.In your sister-in-law’s (meager) defense, it can be awkward to ask family members for payment, especially in the context of a sibling’s deployment. She may also have felt guilty about putting a price tag on minding her nephews, whom she probably loves. Talk to her again. Before you do, though, decide how much you feel comfortable paying her. (Covering the cost of cross-country travel seems like a no-brainer, along with a reasonable estimate of her “piecemeal assistance.”)Say: “Your brother and I really appreciate your help! Now, let’s talk about payment.” Share your proposed sum and how you arrived at it, then ask her what she’s thinking. (If necessary, ask her to show her work.) For good will, I’d skip the fact that she raised the subject only after it was too late for you to bargain for services. I get that this is not what you wanted, but it’s what you got. And in the family context, it’s probably better to pay up..Miguel PorlanNo Body Talk!Two months into a new job, I got engaged. Since then, my diet and exercise habits have been scrutinized by the men in my office. I’ve known for years which foods and exercise programs work best for my physical and mental health, and I haven’t deviated from them. So, for these guys to suggest that I’ve changed my patterns to get “wedding-body ready” is extremely insulting! The wedding is still 10 months away. How do I address this?S.Call out the obvious sexism here. But remember that everyone makes mistakes. (And you still have to work with these guys, right?) Say: “My diet and exercise routines haven’t changed for years. And if I were a man, I doubt you’d be focusing on my ‘wedding body.’ What’s up with that?” It’s a legitimate question.They may apologize, squirm or defensively give examples of women who obsessed over their bridal appearance. By asking the question, though, you put these men on notice that you won’t tolerate sexist stereotypes — not to mention harassment — from co-workers.Pearls for My Girls?I have three teenage daughters and two heirloom pearl necklaces. I don’t wear them. My youngest daughter (the fashionista) asked me if I had pearls. I showed her the simpler necklace and told her she could wear it when she liked. When her eldest sister came home from college, she was angry that I had “given” it to her. I hadn’t! The other necklace is a fancier triple strand. I could always have that one restrung as two necklaces, so each of the girls could have one. But so far, our middle daughter hasn’t expressed any interest. Help!or now, why not tell your daughters they can borrow the necklaces when they like? If they have trouble creating a sharing schedule, you can help them. In my experience, teenagers may be a bit young to understand the sentimental value of family heirlooms. So I wouldn’t ask any long-term questions yet.If I’m wrong about your daughters, or when you decide they’re old enough, ask them if they’d like an heirloom pearl necklace. If all three say yes, remake the triple strand into two necklaces. If your middle daughter remains indifferent to pearls, give her first choice on another piece of jewelry to be claimed after you die.Then let the girls take turns choosing from the remaining items in your jewelry box and keep a list. It may sound macabre, but letting heirs pick from personal property can be a sensible way to allocate it, in advance and without conflict.About Your Future Wife …What is the etiquette of telling someone you saw his fiancée on Tinder when you don’t know what their situation is? They may be open or poly. We’re not super close — more like acquaintances on the friendship scale. I considered swiping right to see if we match so I could ask her directly!J.J.I would keep quiet here. Your question seems to be fueled by idle curiosity (with maybe a splash of attraction for the fiancée) rather than a desire to help your friend. That’s no reason for butting in."
